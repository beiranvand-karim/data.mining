2221	March 31, 2013	Booked hotel for a single night stay when I had a meeting in NY. Full disclosure - intended to stay at the Park Avenue South location but my travel department booked the wrong location. At check-in I had to initial a document 4 times basically promising I would not smoke or destroy property etc. I get to my room which had a strong cigarette smell and ashtrays in the room. Since I was concerned about being charged for smoke remediation, I asked the desk about the smell and ashtrays. Apparently they put me In a "smoking optional" room. Not sure why I needed to sign a waiver then. They explained that they had no other king room. They did manage to find a room with 2 doubles. I was very surprised that they did not tell me. I did check out the penthouse lounge but it seemed populated with 20 something's hiding in corners. At over $500 per night for the room, I was completely underwhelmed.
2222	March 31, 2013	Great location fun neighborhood friendly staff. Loved John at the door.\n\nI will stay here again\n\nWe had a Room with a terrace was awesome. Beautiful weather to sit outside.\n\nClose to everything. Shops restaurant. Easy access.
2223	March 30, 2013	We met a friend from England in NYC and stayed in a suite ! the service was wonderful. The room was amazing. The hotel is very chic. Front desk staff was extremely helpful in all aspects of our stay. The pool seemed like a fun hang out spot in the summer. IT was a bit cold while we were there. Location is ideal with plenty to walk to including the high line and Chelsea market. Swanky music playing throughout the hotel which added to the experience. Who said New Yorkers aren't friendly? They are here!\n\nThe noise from the club was a bit of a problem if you wanted to go to bed before 3am, but other than that it was a great stay.
2224	March 29, 2013	We had the rooms on the corner with the walk out balconies and everything was spectacular! The rooms are clean and beautiful with outstanding views. The club upstairs was absolutely perfect and the staff was top notch from start to finish! Can't wait to do it again.
2230	March 28, 2013	What a great hotel! Far exceeded my expectations, which are very high. Excellent staff, decor, and amenities. Hands down best hotel experience ive had in NYC. Luxurious rooms with incredible views and a close proximity to night life, restaurants and shopping make this hotel a no brainer when choosing a place to stay
2273	February 14, 2013	We stayed here in a back in November 2012, Smack in the middle of the meat packing district with fantastic places to eat at anytime of the day on your doorstep. Every member of Staff was smiling and genuinely attentive. It makes a difference when people enjoy their work..\nThe bar on the top terrace has amazing views. The music is LOUD and the place was rocking every night we stayed.\nReally enjoyed our stay thank you..
2231	March 25, 2013	I want to thank the staff of the Gansevoort for an outstanding experience. From my initial arrival at which time Ben upgraded me to a Manhattan Suite at no cost, to the prompt, courteous, and friendly service provided by Stefanie and Jenny, to the amazingly fast drinks provided by Heather at the rooftop lounge despite the crush each night, I could not have had a better stay. On Saturday night as I was wading through the crowd in the lounge which was packed to near capacity (great vibe and scene, though the DJ needs to up his game), one of the numerous employees I had met a day and a half prior at checkin remembered my name and asked me how I was enjoying the night. I'm returning at next opportunity.
2232	March 25, 2013	I splurged for my 25th birthday with a deal on a suite here from Jetsetter. Could not have been happier! The room was beautiful, with two balconies and amazing views. Walking distance to a bunch of great bars and restaurants. Since my suite was a corner room, it was the perfect place to have a bunch of friends drop by to celebrate the evening - I was worried about noise, but let's just say this is not the hotel where people bring their kids and are asleep by 10 on a Saturday. While there was a long line to get to the rooftop bar, the doormen and front desk staff were very polite to my guests and let them up promptly, once I gave them the green light to do so.\n\nBut really, I am writing this review to praise Penny, who works at the front desk. Upon arrival I told her I was there for my birthday. We dropped our bags and went for a walk on the highline; by the time we got back, there was a happy birthday cupcake (candle included), a bottle of prosecco, and a nice note from Penny. She was so sweet and made our stay very special!\n\nAt one point we did venture up to the rooftop bar - it had potential, but was jam packed. Seems like word of the great view has gotten around. If you're just looking for a good bar, I would imagine there are better places, just based on how packed it was. Also, if you're looking for a quiet, relaxing stay, this probably isn't it. But for the purposes we were there, we had a blast! Would definitely return.
2233	March 21, 2013	First time we stayed here and it was great. We've been to NY a number of times of the last couple of year and the first time we've stayed in meatpacking. Great location for restaurants, etc and also walking distance to soho. Can be a bit noisy, but hey its got a great vibe. Staff are super friendly and night/day difference to the usual business focused hotels. Concierge service was great in hooking up restaurants, transportation and tickets to a nets game.
2234	March 20, 2013	This is my third time visiting New York in the past 5 months for business and this was probably the best time yet. SOHO is my favorite part of being in New York and I wanted to find a hotel that's close to there. So I tried Gansevoort Hotel and I loved it. The staff is amazing. One of the workers, I think manager (Ben) saved my life when he told me about all the parties that were happening on one of my nights I had to the chance to go out and have some nightlife fun. Maybe that was why this was the best trip yet because I actually got to go out and party. However, the room was clean and I have no complaints. The location is great (less than 10 minutes from SOHO) I recommend this hotel and will being staying here again.
2240	March 20, 2013	This was my first experience of a Gansevoort and I probably won't return. This hotel was just too busy, too loud and a bit too neon.\n\nA key concern was as a woman travelling alone there was no key card security to access the floors. Instead those travelling to the rooftop bar were able to get off on any level they choose.\n\nOn the upside its a trendy location.\n\nSome favourite nearby stops: Pastis for breakfast and take out dinner, Serrafinas for the best pasta bolognese and also the Chelsea markets on a weekend for browsing.
2241	March 19, 2013	Really enjoyed the Gansevoort for a couple of nights during Presidents Day weekend in February. Excellent location is a very lively setting. Just know that weekend night get very loud and quickly remind you that you are in the middle of the aciton. The top floor club literally rocks until very early hours in the morning and after parties when next door are very annoying. The front desk took care of us with the significant upgrade the second night to compensate for a pretty loud experience the first night. Gym is the basement is better than what you typically see in hotels.
2242	March 18, 2013	I came here for only one night but the hotel was ovebooked and as my plane was delayed I ended up in a "smoking room". Worst possible experience of NY. I still paid full price for the room whilst I had booked a non smoking room.
2243	March 12, 2013	A big thanks to the friendly staff at this hotel for accommodating me and a few friends that stayed here for a night in town. We were celebrating a friend's birthday and had an amazing time inside and out of this hotel. Gansevoort Hotel is a prime location for seeing the New York City skyline, dining out, nightlife, shopping and visiting the High Line Park. Everything is conveniently close. We couldn't ask for more! Room service and the front desk were very helpful. The rooms were very spacious and chic, unlike other New York City hotels I've been to. I recommend this place for younger crowds who do not mind noise and nightlife around the neighborhood. I will definitely stay here again. Thanks Gansevoort!
2244	March 11, 2013	Had a blast staying at Gansevoort - not only was the location ideal for shopping, restaurants, and night spots, the staff was so gracious and helpful! Would easily stay here again and recommend it to everyone. The rooms were "big" in NYC size and the decor throughout was such a fun, trendy touch. The rooftop bar was amaze. Can't wait to visit again! Benjamin Chan helped us upon checking in and checking out and was a pleasure to deal with!
2250	March 10, 2013	A big big thank you for a wonderful stay at your Hotel, from the moment I stepped though your doors to the time I left you have made my very first visit it New York City one to remember. I would recommend your Hotel in a heart beat and I would like to personally say thank you to Arielle for all that she did !!
2251	March 9, 2013	Nice hotel. Rooms fairly small, but ok by New York standard. Located not far from the river, where there is a jogging/walking trail.\n\nVery close within walking distance to very nice restaurants.\n\nHousekeeping did not always remove all our trash, we did some shopping and the discarded boxes stayed next to the trash bin for two days.\n\nRoom service was timely, food quality was good.\n\nWould stay there again. Would not recommend if you are looking for a quiet place to stay.\n\nThe bar and lounge area was quite nice, but can be a bit noisy on the weekends.
2252	March 7, 2013	Stylish, friendly, helpful young crew. Nice restaurant attached (Toy). Good food, friendly service. Nice-sized room (for NYC). Be warned that the penthouse is very much a Euroclub atmosphere. Only downsides were a thermostat that didn't really work (I kept the window cracked open to cool the room off and my two colleagues in other rooms had the same issue) and not much storage for clothes (enough for a day or two but if your staying longer you'd be hard pressed to store them anywhere but in the bag you brought them in). I'd stay there again if the meatpacking district is my home base.
2253	March 7, 2013	We stayed here for our "babymoon" - our last trip away before our new baby arrives. We usually stay in hotels a little less expensive but we decided to splurge this time. I was nervous about staying in such a trendy hotel when I was 7 months pregnant. But there were no problems! Unlike other reviewers, I did not have an issue with the noise - there was some noise from the street at night but nothing major and nothing unusual for New York. The location is great - close to the subway and tons of great restaurants. The room was very big for New York hotels and the bathroom had a ton of counter space which was much appreciated. We did not go to the club or anything so I cannot comment on that. If you want to use the spa, book well before you check in because it seems to fill up quickly - I could not get an appointment anytime on the 3 days we were there (but I waited until I had checked in to try to book).\n\nDespite the fact I rated this excellent, there are still a few downsides I should note: First, the bed is small. I think it is a double but they put a queen top on it which just means you fall off when you get to the end of the bed. And the bed is really soft so it's not that comfortable. Although I requested extra pillows and got some great long ones which really helped with comfort. The gym has all the basics you need but is very small so there is no room to stretch or put down a mat or anything. And finally the room was very warm - we tried to adjust using our thermostat but it didn't do anything. I don't think you have control over the temperature of the room which can be frustrating.
2254	February 27, 2013	A second stay over Christmas, and the Gansevoort remains a great place to stay in an amazing part of New York. Christmas in NY had been a long term ambition and it was bitingly cold. The below freezing kept most people out of the pool (except for some Norwegians) however the Gansevoort was perfectly warm and cozy, including the rooftop bar! The understated and courteous service in all areas is exemplary. The rooms are spacious and the beds are some of the most comfortable!!\nThe Gansevoort’s Meatpacking location, which is quiet but somehow seemingly in the middle of everything combined with the sheer fabulousness of the Hotel will keep me coming back
2260	February 27, 2013	We absolutely LOVED our stay!\nI made reservations for my Fiance's birthday, booked a room, ordered a cake (through their website) and had a couples massage.\nThe staff was great! Extremely customer service driven, from the moment I booked my reservation I received an email from MELISSA DeBRUIN ASSISTANT RESERVATIONS MANAGER...asking me for details about our stay to make sure everything went smoothly, she then referred me to the concierge so that we can make dinner reservations, CASSAUNDRA REED (concierge) was extremely knowledgeable and very responsive to my needs.\nWe loved our room, the view, the lounge (not the drinks).\nSome of the things that were not up to our expectations were the following:\nThe Spa experience was not as great as I hoped for...the spa was noisy, too many people conversant and laughing...which did not allow my complete relaxation.\nThe cake that I ordered through the website was too dry:(we barely ate any).\nOverall, we had an amazing time and my Fiance loved his surprise.We will be going back in the Summer!!!
2261	February 26, 2013	After a much needed weekend away, we were looking forward to a fun weekend in NYC. Having stayed at the Gansevoort in the past, we were excited about our stay. After the first night there, that quickly changed. There was a constant boom from the bass from the club inside the hotel. This went on much past 1:00. Then the single pane windows allowed in every sound of passing vehicles, sirens and horns. It was hardly a restful sleep. The next night, we got off our elevator after midnight, only to find people who were at the hotel club, to be mingling on our floor. Hardly tight security. Again, the noise from the club and the streets made for another sleepless night. It was only at 3am when I got up to get the ear plugs did things start to get a little better. When confronting the desk manager the following morning during checkout, we complained about our less than impressive weekend.. Unfortunately his response was that he was not able to provide us with a discount on the room. That was hardly the purpose of the complaint. He then went on to say that if we gave the hotel another chance and stayed with them again, if there was availability,they would upgrade us to suite. Well, hardly good customer service after a sleepless weekend! If we wanted that, we would have stayed home with the kids!!!
2262	February 22, 2013	I am in town last minute a lot and of course never book w/ proper notice.. I've stayed at both Gansevoort properties and my stays have always been extreemly pleasant , From the moment you approach The Front desk you are greeted as if they have been awaiting for your arrival .. such a nice feeling after a red eye flight . They always find a way to squeeze me in Rooms are stylish and very clean and there is always soothing music on when u enter . I never hear chaos or loud noise from the other rooms which is important as i work in nightlife and need my sleep beds are cozy the worst part about the stay is having to check out . Both are convenient to everything however im a downtown ppsn so i love the Meatpacking location :)
2263	February 19, 2013	From the check in with Jenny, our weekend trip was amazing. The downstairs bar is great to play pool. Our room had a balcony and it was wonderful to step out and enjoy the manhattan air. The room has everything you need, especially comfortable beds. We love enjoying the rooftop bar. The dj Saturday night was great and the place was packed. Beautiful views of the city. Can't wait to go back again!!
2264	February 19, 2013	The Gansevoort was an amazing experience from check in to check out. I was warmly greeted by the front desk representative (named Jenny) and several other staff members throughout the hotel during my stay which added to my feeling comfortable and well attended to; it was absolutly wonderful! The romantic package delightfully fufilled my plans for valentines day 100%, I recieved 5star service at a great rate! Everything included in thee package met and exceeded my expectations in service and set up by far! The staff did an amazing job at ensuring the room was set up efficiently to serve the needs/ comfort (in my opinion) for any guest to appreciate and enjoy. I surely intend to revisit! Thanks again Jenny and team for the awesome stay/service!!!!!!!!
2270	February 18, 2013	What a fantastic b-day wknd at the Gansevoort - perfect place to celebrate - sunset on the rooftop on a clear night - can't be beat!!!!! - fantastic location - wonderful and extremely attentive staff - thanks for a great wknd we'll be back to see you again!!!
2271	February 16, 2013	My recent stay with the Gansevoort Meatpacking while on business in New York was all good!\nEspecially Charles and John (at the door). They went out of their way to help while I was in NY........going so far as to have gas brought to my car when I ran out. Ultimately it was more than just helping when we really needed it, it was also the day to day greetings and small things that John and Charles were consistent with, that made our stay really enjoyable.\nSincerely,\nTodd
2272	February 16, 2013	Service was unremarkable. The room was decent but the furnishings and decor were unappealing to me - maybe I'm too boring to appreciate the "sexy" decor. Just days after visiting (2 night stay), I was struggling to remember one standout thing.
2274	February 11, 2013	I stayed for a two-night girls weekend last October and I loved the vibe. The rooms are sleek, modern and vibrant, with just enough edge to feel like you're about to have a great night out in the city.\n\nI stayed in a Grand Deluxe Suite, the room is a bit over 500 square-feet and I highly recommend this room if you're looking for a place to hang without feeling like you're in a NYC closet (like many other hotel rooms in NYC). My room had a balcony, couch, dining table and California-King bed, but the disclaimer is the suites are obviously more expensive- for good reason.\n\nThe location is fantastic, the service is impeccable and the rooftop lounge is a great way to end a night out.
2280	February 7, 2013	You have no business here if you are a bunch of thirty something women for a girls weekend. Rooms were small, and music felt throughout the night. Best part for someone like me was waking up early and walking around the neighborhood before anyone else woke up. The front desk is accommodating and friendly. Upon checkin and attempt to valet late night, I got yelled at for having my car in the hotel unloading zone. bc the valet was overwhelmed with clubgoers and cabs. Bottom line- this place is loads of fun if you are in your early 20s. Great location for the hottest clubs within walking distance. Its not for the older crowd.
2281	February 6, 2013	I stayed two nights at the Gansevoort in January 2013. I loved the loved the location and atmosphere of the lobby, my room, and the amazing rooftop bar and lounge. I was very impressed with the customer service staff during check in, with my room service order, as well as the great doormen! My favorite part about my room was waking up and simply flipping a switch next to the bed to open the window shades, letting in the light and amazing view!
2282	February 4, 2013	Upon arrival at the Gansevoort we were immediately impressed. A welcoming staff at the door, a happening and beautiful lounge area, and a very helpful front desk staff. We were booked in a queen superior room and asked if it was possible to change to a king superior room. The young lady at the front desk checked the availability and made the switch.\n\nThe next day, I went shopping and and my husband went to Exhale Spa for a massage. He said the masseuse was amazing and that he would definitely recommend getting a massage.\n\nThe concierge was extremely helpful. They gave us many dinner suggestions in meatpacking and provided a few suggestions outside of the area. They offered to help us make reservations and provided us with the best way to get to our destination.\n\nThe room is modern and quite spacious. The bathrooms are beautiful and immaculate. Our room was always cleaned promptly. Our maid saw us come in on Super Bowl Sunday before the game with pizza and 10 minutes later came back with a bucket of ice for our drinks. A very nice touch that we didn't even ask for!\n\nWe didn't have the opportunity to spend time at the roof top patio, but we went up to take a look on the day we were leaving. What a beautiful view. Can't wait to come back in the summer and spend some time there!\n\nThere was so much to do in meatpacking. Step outside and within a few steps you can find restaurants with delicious food at Pastis, Spice Market, and Catch. The shopping is great too....Tory Burch, Christian Louboutin (men's and women's stores), Hugo Boss, Sephora, just to name a few.\n\nWhen we checked out Jenny helped us arrange a ride to the airport and we let her know that we frequent New York a few times a year. She offered us a business card and let us know that we can contact her when we plan on coming back. With so many hotel options in New York City, I would say that the personalized service is one way that the Gansevoort is sure to be our NYC go to destination.\n\nOverall a great experience. Thanks to the staff at the Gansevoort.
2283	February 2, 2013	I stayed here on business in one of the suites. The hotel could not have done more to help when guests, clients and interviewees arrived.\nThe hotel is 'alive' - the bars are cool and the roof top bar has a great music scene.\nThe modern and regenerated feel of the area lends itself to the style of the hotel. I can't fault it. Location is perfect for exploring the district with all the main bars and restaurants in easy walking distance...yes even in NYC.
2284	January 31, 2013	So I actually never stayed at this hotel but I always go to the Rooftop Lounge. This place is just amazing the music is always good, drinks are good and strong never weak. This place always has the best crowd, I even came one time on Gay night didn't know it was Gay night and I had the best time. I can't even say how many times I've been here because I go that much. It's just beautiful in the summer time especially in the day time you can see all of Meatpacking which is pretty sweet. There is nothing more that I can say amazing amazing drinks, food, fun music and an awesome crowd. I usually go with my boyfriend but it's for all types of people.
2290	January 31, 2013	What happened New York? When did you get so nice? Or is it just the Hotel Gansevoort and their incredible staff? Our tremendous experience all started several months ago when fourteen of us decided to invade New York City to properly observe the official passing of what youth I had left for my 50th BIrthday. Megan in reservations was quick to please by kindly offering a very attractive room rate for the seven rooms we booked. She was very expedient with e-mail confirmations and a follow up call. Shortly before our trip, my partner of eleven years decided that it would be a fitting birthday gift if we tied the knot while in the city with our closest friends. Nothing fancy just exchanging of vows. I called the Gansevoort to inquire about venues in the hotel for a very informal ceremony. Once again, they amazed us. Jenny at the front desk was extremely nice and suggested we think about the roof top loft. She helped us by suggesting the right time of day to avoid the crowds at the adjacent Plunge Roof Top Bar and by coordinating with the hotel and Plunge staff.\n\nWhen we arrived at The Gansevoort, Jenny was there to greet us. Not only did she upgrade my partner and me to a wonderful room, but all of our friends as well. The hotel staff was attentive throughout our four day stay. Joel and his staff at Plunge and the Roof Top Loft went above and beyond the call of duty to make our vow exchange very memorable.\n\nIf the incredible staff were not enough, The Gansevoort has some of the largest rooms in NYC. They are funky and fun, and full of little extras, like the house made CD that is playing in your room when you arrive. Also, the hotel location cannot be beat. The Meatpacking district is one crazy area. You can walk to many of the hottest restaurants (Spice Market, Abe & Arthur's, Buddakan, Crispo, Pastis) and the Chelsea Market is one black away.\n\nWatch out Hotel Gansevoort, you might just give New York City a nice reputation!!
2291	January 31, 2013	Hotel Gansevoort is a modern hotel in the meatpacking district - a convenient walk, metro, or taxi to just about anywere in NYC. The staff are amazingly courteous, helpful and attentive. The room was beautiful, with an excellent bed and great bathroom. It seems that every time I left the room, when I returned, someone had been there to change towels, set the lighting, or clean up. My only complaint is the older CD player system on which only one speaker worked. Oh, and the bedside clock has a older plug-in for an iPod that doesn't work with an iPhone.
2323	January 3, 2013	All in all it was a good trip. Centrally located to all the nightlife in manhattan. Friendly staff. Rooms are a bit small. They made us wait until 3pm to check in even though we had just came in from a red eye. Very expensive to stay here. Everyone expects a tip immediately. I would only stay here again because my girl likes it.
2324	January 3, 2013	Stayed at the HG for Christmas from the 22 to 28 December. This was out first time staying in the meatpacking. It is quite a distance from Midtown and the rest of the tourist NYC attractions but was nice to be out of the way and living in the 'village' for a little while.\n\nThere are some great bars around here such as the Turks and Frogs and the Left Bank so the village is worth exploring\n\nWe were hoping to check in on our arrival at 2pm but unfortunately the room was not ready until 3pm, this was fine as check in is from there and the staff at HG did everything they could to try and get the room ready before 3 so we could change and get to our reservation but it was not to be.\n\nWe went up to the rooftop pool bar on the staffs recommendation. I have to say this was the one and only time we did go up there. It is used every night for parties and for the hip NYC people to meet and have drinks, and we presume to hold pool parties in the summer. For this reason the room was not in its best state and could have done with a few licks of paint and new furniture which has obvs been mistreated by party goers to the HG over the years. It was also cold and expensive (even though the champagne came in plastic glasses). We arrived with another couple who felt the same, after 1 drink both couples left to go to the lobby bar which was a lot warmer and better kept. Saying that, the white painted wall opposite the bar could have also done with a topcoat, just little touches which are noticeable but easy to rectify.\n\nBecause we didn't get to our room until after our reservation the sight of the rooftop bar did worry us that the hotel suite would be the same. However we shoulnd't have worried as it was nice and spacious. We had a bedroom, 2 bathrooms and a living room with a TV which was more than enough space for the 2 of us. All of the rooms were nicely decorated - there were a few random full length photos of models in the room, some of which felt as though they were looking at you which was a bit creepy. Aside from this is was decorated well. Loved the additional wardrobes. The bathroom glass was cracked in the corner - just another thing that could have been fixed beforehand.\n\nThe mini bar and mini sweetie store in the room is very cute - until you see the prices, they were quite exceptional! A 1/4 bottle of champagne was $50 which is a tad steep. There are so many drugstores in the area don't be tempted to use the mini bar or eat the sweets and crisps!\n\nThe only time we ate in the hotel was room service. It arrived both times within 20 minutes and the portions were huge! Just be careful again with the prices as they seem reasonable on the menu but then there is an additional tax and delivery charge of $5 extra on top, so the price looks attractive but is not a true reflection of what you will pay.\n\nOn Christmas Day we spend a couple of hours in the Lobby Bar. The bar tender was very entertaining and kept his bar lovely and tidy - recommend you go and see him!!\n\nEveryone in the hotel was nice and friendly, the doormen remember you and there is usually someone on the lift who calls the lift down for you when you walk through the door.\n\nOverall we had a fab time in the HG. I had heard that it was quite noisy and the disco was too loud into the early hours but we heard none of this. We had a very relaxing peaceful stay.\n\nThanks HG for your kind service and pleasant stay. Will come back to try the HG Park Ave soon!
2292	January 26, 2013	After one year me and my wife returned for our wedding anniversary to NY and stayed again in the meatpacking district.\nWe changed hotel and choose the Gansevoort. The hotel is in the heart of meatpacking, it is quite expensive and especially during Friday and Saturday it seems to be in a night club with a lot of noise and people dancing everywhere.\nBeing an hotel guest allows you to avoid the bouncers and enter the clubs that are in the hotel, that as I said before during the WE are packed.\n\nBreakfast is good although a bit pricey. Rooms are not too big but they a have a nice view On top beside the club there is also a pool with a stunning view.\nBathroom is quite small but you have all the amenities you might need.\n\nOne suggestion try to avoid to take goods from the minibar as they are really overpriced
2293	January 24, 2013	I travel to NY every other week on business, and will only stay at the Gansevoort from now on. The rooms are comfortable, the location is impossible to top (abdndant nightlife, restaurants, etc), but the best thing about the Gansevoort is the staff. They are all so knowledgeable, friendly and professional. I've had two seperate instances where they've moved mountains to help me track down lost property, and rearrange travel plans. To an individual, this is the most courteous and wonderful staff i've seen in a hotel anywhere.
2294	January 23, 2013	We stayed here from Boxing Day to New Years day, and found this hotel through booking.com it was coming in as the 2nd cheapest on that day. We found the location good & located fairly close to the tube with easy access to all tourist destinations. Also had some good shops in & around the hotel. I would definately stay here again if it was reasonably priced.
2300	January 22, 2013	The Hotel Gansevoort was chosen as our hotel while recently in New York City strictly because of location. We were helping someone settle into nearby housing and wanted to be close by so we did not do our usual Tripadvisor search for the best place, we simply went with location. That said, we were satisfied with this hotel.\n\nPROS: Reservations were quick and easy online through the hotel site. The room was very spacious and comfortable, especially the beds. The evening turn down service was appreciated as they filled the ice bucket nightly. Staff was very responsive to requests and got our pre-arrival requests correct. The bathroom was spacious with plentiful hot water and great water pressure in the shower. Loved the location!\n\nCONS: We had to call for extra blankets as we had no control over the room temperature and it got a little cool during the night (blankets solved the issue). The hotel is modern and "trendy," for lack of a better word and their "artwork" in the room was not to my taste. It is in a busy area so you do hear street noise at night. The lobby is dark and feels a little cold and unwelcoming.\n\nOVERALL: The location is awesome - near the subway, shops and restaurants all around, the High Line park and Chelsea Market are right there - it's a great location! For our needs - a place to get a good night's sleep after a day of moving or wandering around the city, the Hotel Gansevoort provided a comfortable and convenient stay in a spacious room with really comfy beds.
2301	January 22, 2013	Just returned from an excellent four-day stay at the Hotel Gansevoort.\nThe location of the hotel is superb with great shopping and restaurants nearby, particularly the Spice Market and Del Posto. On weekends the area is action packed. One of the largest lineups for entry on the weekends seemed to be at the Hotel Gansevoort. It was particularly nice that the night doorman Jimmy, early on in our stay, recognized our party as hotel guests and greeted us warmly every evening on our return from dinner, as we easily bypassed the line up waiting to get in. Jimmy was warm, personable and quick to help in other ways. He is part of what is overall a friendly and attentive staff.\nI was also delighted to find, upon my arrival at 8 am, that the 11th floor river view room I requested was ready. Even better, the staff member who helped me to my room suggested that I also take a look at the room that adjoined the suite of my travelling companions. This turned out to be an excellent recommendation. This is a great room configuration for a family or group of friends travelling together. We were on the 11th floor with one corner suite, plus a private common entry way and an adjoining deluxe one bedroom with river view.
2302	January 22, 2013	We stayed here during September 2012. We had booked a Deluxe room and we had a really good view opver NYC.\nThe service is good and the staff very helpfull. We really loved the location with walking distance to Pastis, High Line, Standard Grill Chealsea Market etc.\n\nThe room was clean and the beds good.\nThe usually ate breakfast at the hotell and the buffé was good with a lot of fresh fruit.\n\nWe will definitly come back!
2303	January 20, 2013	We stayed at the Gansevoort for 4 nights from 14/1/13 in room 1102 - this was our first time exploring the meatpacking district and we weren't quite sure what to expect - we were delighted! The hotel was cool, contemporary and had a sexy edge! The staff were welcoming, genuine and informative. The rooftop pool and bar has amazing views and a great place to see and be seen. The area has several great restaurants and shops and our stay was too short to visit them all - so we'll be back!
2304	January 18, 2013	Now the holidays are over, I needed to recap on my vacation in New York and New Jersey. I stayed at Hotel Gansevoort for most of my 2 week trip and It was NOT disappointing at all. Now for the review... where do I start?!!? First of all, it's in the "meat packing district"(if you don't know where and what that is google.. too much to explain but it's gooood) rooms are MODERN and CLEAN.. what more do you want.. plus you should be out most of the time! (I was) I met the greatest people in NYC. I have a few friends that live in Brooklyn and they showed me a great time. Everything is so close together it doesn't matter where you are. Next... ROOFTOP BAR! it's a great view but since it was cold they closed many of the outside seating but they still had a smoking section open (very pleased). When I first arrived to the hotel I expected a taller/bigger building and was kind of dissapointed but after going to the rooftop.. it didn't even matter. Now for the final crit.. the staff.... veeerrry nice. If they are just trained to be nice or pretending .. it doesn't matter. They were consistant with everything and helped me when I had a question .. even for breakfast I would go straight to the manager, Mr. Benjamin Chan, who knew his thing about not only the are but about New York City. I don't if I ever been to a hotel where I can talk to a manager without requesting him and just walk up and get information 1,2,3. I stayed at the Venetian before in Las Vegas and the concierge would always have to look up, call, or ask someone else for information. Cabs are always around with a big street right in front of the hotel.\nDo I recommend this hotel .. yes.. will I stay here again .. (I would like to try different hotels .. but I would be nervous that I would regret that I should've just stayed at the gansevoort.
2331	January 2, 2013	Everything about The Gansvoort Hotel was great. Best location in Manhattan, great service, very nice room, cool rooftop bar and friendly staff. I will recommend it to everyone. The Meatpacking District is the best place to live at and The Gansvoort Hotel couldn't be a better choice if you ask me.
2310	January 16, 2013	I stayed at many hotels in NY but the GANSEVOORT was the best , i traveled from Denmark and it was a long flight and was so happy when i got to the hotel at around 8am to hare my room was available , upon arriving the doorman got my bag from the taxi and welcome me with a smile the the front desk person was really nice , i was then assisted by Omar who was very nice and told me about the rooftop bar and pool , spa gym and hair salon, into the room he point the safe showed me the menu for room service and said there are available 24 hour incase i need to place an order he also showed me the (do not disturb sign GET OUT) after i had told him that i had a long flight and needed sleep , he suggested that i put it on my door so i wont be disturb by housekeeping , i really enjoyed my stay and looking forward to stay again and this hotel and would definitely recommended it ,, Thank you Omar
2311	January 15, 2013	My wife and I were invited for a Saturday night dinner at Catch with two other couples. We were told Catch is across the street from the Hotel Gansevoort, so I figured why not make a reservation here. After a little research, we booked a Grand Deluxe room on the 10th floor overlooking the river. Fantastic.\n\nWe're twice the age of the other guests and a different demographic, but no worries. Loved the way the room was furnished and the view and the vibe. The staff were really nice to us.\n\nAfter a truly fabulous dinner (with lots of wine) at Catch the six of us crossed the street back to the hotel to continue the evening. Guests of the hotel have immediate access to the club on the top floor, rather than waiting in the line outside in the cold. We went up to the club but it was way too noisy for us to talk. Our room had a sitting area by the window so we went back down to the room.\n\nI called to room service for a bottle of vodka and some ice. Oh and some cranberry juice. The room service bill was $499. Really? That was more than the hotel room. Life in the big city.
2312	January 15, 2013	The staff at the Gansevoort were very good. Our room wasn't ready on arrived so we headed up to the roof bar for cocktails to kill some time. Our check in assistant came to tell us that our room was ready, to hand over the key and let us know our bags were already in the room. He even took photos of our group and emailed them to us later that day. The Gansevoort is ideally placed for some great nightlife and restaurants; Catch, Spice Market and Buddakan are all just over the road. The concierge did a great job of not only getting us into some great restaurants, we also got really good tables in each. The room was a decent size by New York standards and the bed was comfortable. The only drawback with this hotel is the noise. There's a bar on the ground floor, one on the roof and a club next door. Having read others' reviews on this site we asked for a quiet room and we didn't have the noise from the street bothering us in the same way that it did our friends on a lower floor. However, you can hear the bass from the music well into the early hours of the morning even in a 'quiet room'. If you're going to be out all night and aren't really interested in sleep then this hotel is definitely worth a visit. If you need at least a few hours of sleep each night and don't sleep like the dead then choose somewhere a little quieter.
2313	January 14, 2013	Took my wife here for her 30th birthday, weekend of January 12. This is the coolest hotel in the trendiest neighborhood in Manhattan to stay in. The rooms are very hip and upscale (not always a given- we've been in hotels that were trendy but they forgot to be great hotels!). The room is designed well, the view is great and the beds were very comfortable. The atmosphere is perfect if you want to be part of the "scene". The nightclub on the rooftop is great, the spa was amazing (my wife said it was one of her favorites ever) and the service was terrific as well (thank you Jenny and Paul:)) Also, the neighborhodd is so different than the typical Manhattan locales, it has a very cool artsy vibe. Be sure to walk the Highline nearby. We will be back! Highly recommended!!
2314	January 14, 2013	We've visited this hotel several times now. Arriving from London, England, it's like coming home again to New York. The staff are highly professional. We get a warm welcome on arrival; this sets the scene for the rest of our stay. Big comfortable beds, super bathrooms, close to subway, always taxis available, excellent shops nearby, the surrounding streets at times remind us of London, with the Georgian architecture . . . Leaving after our last visit, we arrived at JFK and realised we had left a suitcase in the room. A call to the hotel, and a member of staff had the case with us in time for our flight. We're looking forward to our next visit already.
2320	January 11, 2013	Stayed on the 11th floor of this chic and very comfortable hotel. Staff were incredibly attentive, professional and friendly--which is a real game changer for hotels in NYC! In fact, front desk staff provided me a list of gluten-free restaurants w/o my asking for it. {web research anyone?}\n\nThe rooms are cozy with great showers / sink design, rooftop pool, and 2 onsite restaurants--although there are plenty of places to eat in this area. Subway stations are walking distance from the hotel.\n\nNice surprise since my last business trip to NYC where I stayed at the Affinia Shelburne and received tons of attitude and a "go away we are too busy to talk to you" experience. When I requested a bath mat, staff told me I should have reserved a disability friendly room!
2321	January 10, 2013	First stayed at this hotel a couple years ago in a standard room. While the room wasn't large, I've stayed in much smaller ones uptown. This hotel has the most central location in the meatpacking area. This time I opted for the Manhattan Suite which has 1 1/2 baths and a step out balcony. I have to say the staff was perfect both times. This time we received a complimentary bottle of wine and small box of Godiva. The Cutler bath amenities were lovely and plentiful. Very comfortable. It was freezing outside with the wind off the water and all we had to do was cross the street for a great meal. Five minutes to shopping, restaurants and Chelsea market. I do plan on going back there again. Yes, it is pricey, but around fall you can find discounts through winter.
2322	January 5, 2013	Stayed from the end of December 2012 until January 2013 for 9 nights.\nHotel location is in the fantastic meatpacking district with lots of sights nearby (such as: high line park, Chelsea market and SoHo) and only one block away from a main subway route.\n\nUnfortunately you pay a high price for the name and image whilst you only get a small room with no tea/ coffee making facilities.\n\nIn-room prices are extortionate at $9 for a bottle of water. Given that there's "one of the top clubs in the meatpacking district" located in the penthouse, every evening you'd come home to a queue of people in front of the hotel and you'd have to clearly distinguish yourself as a guest rather than a clubber.\nOn a side note, the music played was two years behind European club music (at least) and was frequented by a wide range of ages from spotty teens to women with their mothers.\n\nOverall, the hotel is fancy and you pay for the name. However, the location couldn't be better!\n\nMake sure you ask for a room above the 7th floor for better views.
2330	January 2, 2013	Great hotel with young atmosphere and very pleasant employees . The location is the best to those who like to enjoy the city days and nights . Great hotel with reasonable price clean and comfortable room . The wi-fi should be improved ! Gym is good .
2332	December 27, 2012	I spent one night at the hotel with my family on Dec 22nd. This hotel was amazing place to stay- great location, comfortable and quiet! Gym was great and spa was excellent. Staff was very gracious and accommodating. Front door staff really great at hailing you a cab and very friendly. I am looking forward to going back on Valentine's Weekend with my wife...shhhh its a surprise!! Everyone should try this hotel!!!
2333	December 26, 2012	Last weekend my family and I decided to go to New York City for one night to see the Christmas tree and have dinner and see all the great store displays. We decided to stay at Hotel Gansevoort in the Meatpacking since it was away from all the crowd. The staff at the hotel were wonderful....our check in was very efficient and fast. The room was gorgeous, very trendy and stylish, our kids loved it. We received champaign and cup cakes half hour after arriving!\n\nThe next day we had breakfast in room and it was delicious. I would recommend this hotel to all my friends and family. Very kids friendly!!! Looking forward to our next visit!
2334	December 22, 2012	We came to New York for a third visit to see our daughter who is interning here for a year - it was by far our best visit, helped enormously by the hotel and the area of New York it is situated.\n\nI was not expecting too much with regard to New York friendliness or standards - it can be a harsh city. However, we were very satisfied with the Hotel Gansevoort and it's staff. It's quite a "party" hotel and the rooms are equipped and furnished to comply. The large portrait photographs on the bedroom Walls were a bit shocking when you first wake up but you soon got used to them. The rooms were serviced twice day with a turn down service at night and our room had full length French windows with a good view.\n\nThe best view however was from the outdoor pool on the top floor. Absolutely stunning view across the Hudson toward Hoboken and in the opposite direction looking at the Chrysler building.\n\nWhen you walk out the hotel doors, the staff were extremely friendly offering to get you cabs whenever you needed. However within a short walk you find yourself in Greenwich Village which is one of my favourite areas. I could wander through Greenwich Village continuously with it's quaint bookshops and cute stores, delicious restaurants and delis. You can reach some of the most well known areas of New York though with much ease and yet easily escape back to this very fashionable district at the end of the day.\n\nSurrounding the outside pool is the Plunge rooftop lounge and bar which got very busy and vibrant some evenings which was lovely. I believe it's one of "the places" to go if you're not resident.\n\nAll in all a delightful trip, peppered with some out of the way places to go and all helped by this very lovely and vibrant ( which you can dip in and out of) hotel and area.
2340	December 20, 2012	I booked a suite for 2 nights for business purposes. On the 11th floor. Room was nice and clean, but you pay for the view and meatpack district too, ofcourse. Personel was friendly. But indeed, as in other reviews; for "normal" guests, the music is too loud in the restaurant. But the food is really delicious and of a high standard but not haute cuisine. It is not my kind of people who arrive on Saturday evening, but it didn't bother me. It was more a kind of "sightseeing" and fun.\nNot suitable for children.
2341	December 19, 2012	Special thanks to Nadia and Omar - you made my stay FANTASTIC!!! My room wasn't available at check in and both Nadia and Omar were very accommodating. I had a late breakfast and my room was ready. On day 2, I was even impressed that both of them remembered my name. This type of customer service is a rare commodity.\n\nSee you on my next trip.
2342	December 10, 2012	We just returned from our trip to New York, which was overall magnificent. Although are stay at the Gansevoort was not perfect, we enjoyed our time there. My first complaint, we had specifically asked for connecting rooms since our 2 daughters and a friend were going to be staying in the room next to us. Upon entering our room, there was not a door connecting to the next room. Next, we went to the room our daughters were staying in, and discovered a king bed, when we asked for two doubles. So we went downstairs to try and switch rooms, but nothing that matched our request was available. They did offer to move us the next morning, but what a pain that would have been after unpacking. Luckily, the couch turned into a sofa bed so our daughters and our friend were able to have enough sleeping space. My biggest complaint is the noise. If you want a good night sleep, bring ear plugs. The sound of horns and sirens are constant. At one point, during a restless night, I started counting moments of silence; I did not get past 5 seconds without hearing a horn or siren. Lastly, the rooms are really warm at night. When my husband complained they told him they turn off the air during the winter and we need to open our window. This is impossible to do if you want to sleep. The noise was so loud with the window closed, I could not imagine leaving it open and getting a moment of sleep.\nAlthough, there are a bunch of negatives, the hotel had its positives qualities as well. First, the sizes of the rooms were nice compared to other hotels in New York. The bathrooms were clean and nice. The location is great. The hotel is in the meatpacking district, so there are a lot of great places right next to the hotel. A 10 minute walk will get you to Soho, and a 20 minute walk to Little Italy. There is a bar down in the lobby area that gets pretty busy at night and has a pool table.\nOverall, my biggest complaint is the noise. The Gansevoort is nice hotel. I mean, we did spot Richard Branson there, but he probably did not have an issue with the noise in the penthouse.
2343	December 6, 2012	We stopped here with friends over Thanksgiving. The hotel it self is OK but nothing special. The rooms were hot at night and the street outside can get very noisy late at night. We were woken by police sirens and loud shouts at 4am in the morning. In fairness my clubbing days are a little behind me and this hotel would suit a younger crowd.
2344	November 25, 2012	Great staff, fantastic service and a great location. Much better than staying in mid town even if, as for us, the main purpose of the holiday was shopping. $10 will get you into town for the shops and you will not regret staying in a much better neighbourhood which has bars, restaurants and all night diners for late night NY cheesecake runs.. Great roof top bar and swimming pool.\nOnly warning is that if you are travelling with kids or you're after a nice quiet spa holiday then best look elsewhere. Also make sure you have enough in the budget for drinks at the roof top bar, it's pricey but worth it and we asked for a quiet room and didn't hear any noise at all during the night.\nAll in a perfect hotel for a few days shopping and going out in Manhattan.
2350	November 21, 2012	I just returned from an absolutely wonderful stay at the Gansevoort - Meatpacking District property. The service, ambiance, and location were just superb. And, my room (Deluxe Room) was just wonderful, with a very comfortable bed, and great bathroom. I enjoyed a quiet night's rest in this very active neigborhood. While I was in NYC this time for business, I will return here for both business and pleasure. I highly recommend you enjoy a stay at his fantastic property, in a fun neighborhood.
2351	November 18, 2012	I stayed in the hotel during hurricane sandy at the park/29th location. The weekend was supposed to be a romantic getaway for two, but on sunday night the storm hit us hard. I can't say enough about the staff who pulled together at a difficult time to make sure we were taken care of during difficult circumanstances. It is an experience i wont forget and want to commend the staff on their exemplary corteousness and professionalism
2352	November 15, 2012	We were a few years behind the curve in terms of visiting this place, but its hip credentials still seemed to be well in place, right down to a group of beautiful people, dressed completely in black, swaying out the entrance as we lurched, all too colourfully, in.\nSpacious, comfortable and fun interconnecting rooms, suitably dimly lit corridors and the famous rooftop pool which we didn't have time to test.\nBrilliant location - walked the Highline the next morning.
2353	November 13, 2012	I recently stayed at the Gansevoort with my family arriving the Saturday prior to the arrival of superstorm Sandy. Our rooms were a good size by NYC standards and well appointed. Generally the hotel had a great atmosphere and of course it is in a fantastic location in the Meatpacking District. However this turned into a trip like no other with the arrival of Sandy.\nThe power went out as we sat in the bar on the Monday evening. There was nothing else to do but turn in early and see what the morning unveiled. It's only after when you come home and reflect on what you experienced that you really get a true sense of how devastasting this storm was.\nWith regard to the Gansevoort staff I cannot compliment them enough for their professionalism in dealing with the situation. Every member of staff we encountered from the maintenance guy upwards was excellent, and when the hotel took the decision to close on the Wednesday because of the continued lack of power the Management Team worked very hard to secure accomodation for my family elsewhere in NYC.\nWe never got to sample the full range of what the hotel has to offer, but we will definitely be back.
2354	November 5, 2012	We stayed at the Gansevoort during Hurricane Sandy. The staff was so professional, cared about us and went out of their way to take care of us and make sure we were safe and happy. The rooms are very big for New York standards, many rooms have little balconies where the door opens for fresh air. The decor is very modern, but very comfortable. There is a roof deck and pool which is awesome. By far, it was the classiest place I have stayed because of the amazing staff. When the power and water went out during the hurricane, they helped us look for other hotels, got coffee and food delivered which was not easy. Upon my return, I even got a letter where they told us they discounted our stay due to no power. None of this was their fault, but again, they care about their guests. Awesome neighborhood as well, great shops and restaurants!
2360	November 1, 2012	The Gansevoort in the meatpacking district is a boutique hotel in a trendy neighborhood with great restaurants. By "boutique" I mean small. That applies to the number of floors as well as the room size. Our family of four met my cousin from The Netherlands, there for a weekend in October. We reserved a suite for $850/night which was essentially 2 tiny rooms and 2 balconies that served to let in the noise at 3 a.m. The hotel is not protected by other buildings as it is on a small block with one other building that holds a night club that gets out around 3 a.m. every night. Thus the partiers who are unsure where to go at quitting time get to stand in the 3 streets that surround the hotel and block traffic resulting in a cacauphony of honks for one hour. Blessedly everyone remembers where they live by 4 am. On the positive side the pool was great for the kids and the hotel left cupcakes for us in our room. My cousin changed hotels after we left.
2361	October 31, 2012	Obviously, the location of the hotel is great. Meatpacking is a fantastic area, perfectly located in between great shops and restaurants and the top clubs in the city. However I travel regularly for a living, and have stayed in some of the most wonderful hotels in the world.\nFor the rate that we payed for this hotel room, the hotel really did not meet the standard that it should have.\nThe spa, in particular, was completely pointless and disappointing. We spent an hour in there waiting for the heating to rise in the spa, and the sauna to work, and nothing seemed to be heating. We waited there for about an hour when they said that they would turn it up, and still nothing. When we finally decided to leave after freezing ourselves in a cold shower, the staff member said to us very unapologetic that they turned the heating off about an hour ago and forgot to tell us.\nThen when asking for a newspaper, I was told that the hotel didnt carry any, and that we could run to the deli if we needed one. This is something any standard hotel in the world should have.\n\nThe room service is over priced, and not good at all!\nWe had no room service menus in our room to begin with, and then were told that the delay was going to be over an hour, to receive a $30 burger that was worse than something I could have bought at KFC.\n\nThe staff and service at the front were super nice, I cannot say anything bad about the staff, they were probably the only reason I never complained about all of this in the first place.
2362	October 16, 2012	I stayed at the Gansevoort with my wife this past month for our 2nd Anniversary. It was a great experience. The hotel is centrally located and very convenient to public transportation. A ton of great restaurants and bars in the area, plus the Highline park. Rooms were top notch and the view was unbeatable. Try to make it to the rooftop bar for drinks, you won't regret it. The staff were really helpful and knowledgeable about the area. One of the front desk managers, Ben, recommended a great restaurant for our anniversary dinner and a spot for drinks nearby. We will definitely come back for another visit!
2363	October 10, 2012	I stayed at the Gansevoort recently as it was conveniently located to my conference and dinner. The location is quite nice and the rooms are clean and well appointed.\n\nI was very disasppointed in the overall experience. At 12 midnight, the alarm clock in the room went off. After multiple attempts to disable the alarm clock I finally unplugged it from the wall.\n\nI was unable to go back to sleep because my 5th floor room faced a street that was very busy. There was noise from patrons leaving the local bar scene and honking horns. This finally subsided by 4am.\n\nIf you like a glitzy hotel, this may be the place for you. If you want a quite night of sleep, I would look elsewhere. For the price, I expect a lot more.
2364	September 30, 2012	I booked a stay at the Hotel Gansevoort Meatpacking to celebrate my birthday with 3 girl friends. I chose to do the Night Owl package. I had originally just booked in two of us, but the other two ended up wanting to stay as well. I presented this scenario to the front desk when I checked, knowing the stay would probably cost more, however they were SUPER helpful and allowed all 4 of us to stay in a double room for the price of 2 adults.\n\nOur package came with a free bottle of Patron and numerous little goodies to go with it. The staff from doormen, to bartenders, front desk, housekeeping, everyone was great. I do have to say that the hallways smelled pretty badly of smoke but our room was free of any odor and had a great view of the district. The bathrooms are large, shower is great and beds are awesome to sleep in.\n\nFor New York, and for Meatpacking, I think the price was pretty reasonable. The walkability to everything just can't be beat. New York will always be expensive but I enjoyed the Gansevoort and would stay there again.
2370	September 26, 2012	This hotel had the best service, best food, most updated and funky room, and best night life. We arrived early for a wholesale show at the Javitts center. The bell boys held on to our luggage and quickly hailed us a cab. Came back later to check in with a very courteous and sweet front desk manager. Our modern style room/suite had two bathrooms and a nice living room space with pullout couch. This worked out for 4 persons staying in the room. The price was cheaper that two separate rooms at other hotels and we were all able to stay together. The rooftop bar has an unbelievable view, great apps, and drinks. The wait staff was incredibly nice also. We walked outside in the morning to see a yoga class going on across the street. Plenty of restaurants, bars and stores all within walking distance. We were sad to leave this beautiful hotel, but happy to come visit again!!
2371	September 25, 2012	my sister booked a suite at the gansevoort for my bachelorette party this past saturday. we had a great time staying at this hotel mainly because of the location and because of the rooftop! it is on the high end of my price range so i would never be able to stay more than a night but that said i didn't see much of a wow factor for such a "high end" hotel. we called room service at some point to bring up extra glasses and they charged us....why??? it's not like it costs them any money...they didn't go out to buy the glasses. that was ridiculous. other than that, if you are looking for a fun, great neighborhood to stay in i would highly recommend
2372	September 25, 2012	We stayed at this hotel during New York Fashion Week and didn't regret it. First of all, it's in a very lively part of town with plenty of restaurants, cafes and boutiques. Catch and Pastis, two very popular eateries, we're right across from the hotel. The hotel is also just a few blocks from the piers if you want to go for a nice jog along the continuously regentrified Hudson Riverwalk. The hotel itself has a very modern, hip vibe. It's also home to a popular lounge, so if you don't want to be around a bunch of hipsters, this may not be the right hotel for you. The front desk staff and doormen were very hospitable, but the concierge staff seemed a bit annoyed when inconvenienced with tourist questions. Perhaps that's just an example of a couple of New Yorkers lacking warmth. Further, the cleaning crews knocked on our hotel door all morning trying to come in to clean, despite us giving them a more convenient time when they could come back. So much for sleeping in... Other than that and the rooms being a bit cramped, you won't be disappointed with this hotel.
2373	September 24, 2012	My wife and I stayed this weekend at Gansevoort to celebrate our youngest going off to college and us being empty-nesters. The location of the Hotel has its pluses and minuses. The good part is that the location is in a very vibrant area with plenty of restaurants and activity. We took a long walk on the high-line, and, browsed many galleries. Chelsea Market is also a plus.\n\nHowever, because of the location, there is plenty of street noise late at night. Our room was on the 5th floor and both nights we were up at 5:00 am due to honking in front of the hotel, as well as the loud occupants next to, above and below our room. Obviously there's not much that the hotel could do for the noise, but we'll know better next time.\n\nThe staff (with the exception of the Bell staff and doormen) were a little pretentious and aloof. I guess that's part of the allure and coolness, so we're not that cool any more. The concierge acted like he was doing us a favor when we asked for a map of the local galleries.\n\nWe were excited to go to the "fitness center", but the 2 treadmills were broken, as well as one of the ellpticals. Looks like it's not a priority.\n\nOverall I expected a little more for $450 a night. However, judging by how the Hotel was booked, there was no recession there.
2374	September 10, 2012	staff at front desk was surprisingly friendly and helpful. I was expecting haughty and diffident.Rooms are decent-small, but functional. had enough room to do yoga. rooms were surprisingly quiet. Interesting location- streets at night are filled with chic fashionistas waiting behind velvet roped clubs to gain entry to drink $20 dollar martinis to deafening music.\nchelsea market is terrific- who ever thought "made in brooklyn" would be a marketing plus!\nnegatives: the exercise room is dank and pitiful. 2 machines are broken. But i guess if the crowd here stays up to 4am, not alot of takers at 6 am. The guy overseeing the rooftop bar was a self important jerk. we had 12 people staying on property for 4 nights and needed to have a brief meeting on sat am upstairs. He cranked up the music when no one else was there. whatever.
2380	September 5, 2012	I've been staying at the Hotel Gansevoort for work since it first opened. I haven't been back in a couple of years though and was expecting the worst--worn rooms and an aging hotel trying to be hip. I found just the opposite: a helpful and friendly staff, spotless & very quiet rooms with updates, and a super comfy bed. The location can't be beat. The neighborhood and rooftop bar are always a scene; even on a rainy night last night, there was an episode of HBO's "Girls" being filmed outside, but once I was inside my room, it was very peaceful and I had a wonderful view uptown from the 10th floor. Expensive, yes, and the rooms are not big (even an upgraded room) but I think it's still a very fair value for NYC.
2381	September 2, 2012	This hotel was a great change of pace. Away from the touristy parts of mid-town. The area around the hotel has a lot to offer, The High Line, Chelsea Market, shopping, great restaurants. It had a much more relaxed feeling during the day. At night, things changed...The hotel has a bar/lounge on the roof. It's one of "the places to be". At night there is a line down the block to get into the hotel. We had to keep showing our room key to get into the hotel. It got annoying that as a guest, we had to wait in the lobby, for a while, with all the bar patrons to get in an elevator. The hotel should have at least one elevator dedicated to hotel guests only. Hotel staff were average, they didn't go above and beyond. The room was clean and a decent size. Very odd shower set up, the water drains in the center of the bathroom so if someone is at the sink while someone is in the shower they are standing in shower water. Overall, I would stay here again.
2382	August 29, 2012	I have to say, I have been married for over 10 years, and we've done the "one night in the NYC hotel experience" thing to mixed results. Be it a small room, crappy decor, or just bad service, our results have been mixed. With the Gansevoort, our experience was nothing short of outstanding. I didn't want to be kitchy and say "Oh, it's our honeymoon" and scream tourist, yet they still rolled out the red carpet for us. The room, by NYC standards was huge, west facing and on a high floor without my request, though the hotel did seem full. It was nice looking down at the SoHo house! We really enjoyed the rooftop pool and the "guests only" area by the pool was a nice oasis to the bar which could get a little elbow-y. The concierge was uber helpful in getting setting up our evening. Would definitely return.
2532	March 14, 2012	Me and my husband have just got back from a 4 days trip in NYC. We always stay in Meatpacking District, and this time we've decided to try Gansevoort Hotel. It was very, very nice ! The service is good. Jaqueline, the general manager was really nice and got us a room before the check-in time... this was really, really amazing !\nI just think that the Concierge service could improve a little.\nThank you very much for everything !
2383	August 28, 2012	This was my first experience at this hotel and location in NYC. The location can't be better. Close to the High Line, great restaurants, shopping, Chelsea Market, and nightlife. Rooms are nicely decorated. Weird shower (the water goes into the vanity and toilet area as the floor of the shower is almost level with the rest of the bathroom). Problem with loud guests but hotel took care of it quickly. Small rooftop pool with very limited seating. What bothered me the most was at night. As a guest, paying top dollar, I had to wait to go up to my room while the nonguests who want to go to the rooftop got preference to go up in an elevator before me and my guest. They should either have them wait or designate a separate elevator for guests and for nonguests. When you are paying over 500 bucks a night, I don't want to wait for anything.
2384	August 26, 2012	I stayed here for a bachelorette weekend and was really expecting a lot more than we got. The decor is really cool and the rooms are nice enough, but nothing really out of the ordinary especially for NYC. They lost our reservations even though we called to confirm four hours before we checked in. Nthe front desk manager was really nice, but we had to downgrade from a suite to one room with a king bed. That's a little tight for six women. They did refund the difference between the room costs, but only to exactly what it would have cost had we meant to book a single room. The rooftop bar staff was rude to our bachelorette and took very little interest in our group even though we tipped well and ordered a lot of drinks. To make it even worse, a dog barked literally non stop from three am til six. When we called the front desk, the guy who answered actually said and what do you expect me to do about it? With all the choices in NYC and for the price of these rooms, I'd stay somewhere else.
2390	August 21, 2012	We checked into the Gansevoort for a one night get away. We mentioned to the lovely manager who checked us in (and got us an excellent room with a river view) that it was our 20th anniversary, and when we returned from dinner that evening there was a bottle of champagne waiting for us. The same manager gave us vouchers for cocktails at the bar next time we visited because we had to wait 15 minutes for our car when we checked out. I don't remember the last time I experienced such attentive customer service, and that was the same with every staff member we encountered. We loved the rooftop bar--our cocktails were delicious. The pool was lovely, though we wished there had been room for a few more chaise lounges when we showed up at 4 in the afternoon. The room was comfortable and stylish, and the neighborhood is really fun. We will definitely return.
2391	August 17, 2012	The Gansevoort - where urban chic is infused with warm and good quality service. A common sense concept but not always easy to find.\n\nBooked this hotel at the last minute for my husbands birthday yesterday as a surprise instead of travelling home after dinner and a Broadway show. The weather was gorgeous and coupled with the Gansevoort it was a fabulous and refreshing overnight escape. First impressions are key and Luisa at the front desk immediately gave us such a warm welcome and she wished my husband a happy birthday as they must have noted it when I called. She informed us that our room wasn't ready and if we wanted to wait at the bar or the rooftop lounge she would find us when it was available. This is when we were impressed for the second time by Raul. He immediately stepped in to take our bags, assured us we would be contacted when the room was ready and was professional but personable. I was glad the room wasn't ready as the roof top was amazing with breathtaking views - a cutting edge spot to sit out on a Thursday afternoon and soak up NYC. True to their word Raul contacted me after about 20 mins and we even got an upgrade! My husband enjoyed a pre-booked treatment at the spa and then we had dinner right across the street at the Spice Market. By the time we returned from Times Sq to the MP district it was hopping and the rooftop was electric. A little noisy for a nightcap so we sat downstairs at the outside bar which was perfect and provided some great people watching. I will admit service was a tad slow here even though it wasn't very busy. This morning before leaving the city we took advantage of the rooftop pool. It wasn't crowded before 10am and was so unique to have a morning dip looking at the skyline in a gorgeous setting. The downside was there wasn't any coffee or tea available at the rooftop and it wasn't complimentary in the lobby either but it was worth the money to sit at the pool having coffee and croissants!! Overall it was a great experience and I feel this hotel offers style with more warmth and sincere staff interactions than my recent stays at The James or The Trump SoHo and the elevators work a lot faster at the Gansevoort!! I have a pre-planned NYC trip with the girls next week and we are considering treating ourselves by staying here rather than my friends apartment as it checks all the boxes - location, amenities, engaging backdrop, quality service and attentive staff to ensure repeat business. I felt more than just a guest at a top class hotel. Thanks again Luisa and Raul for making the stay so memorable.
2392	August 15, 2012	The Good - The hotel, on the whole, is great, our room was excellant, lovley hudson view, 12th floor. Clean and tidy. Breakfast simple but good. Front desk efficient and helpful. Location is fantastic. We love the meatpacking vibe and the morning runs along the Highline were lovely.\n\nThe Bad - The Roof top bar is cool BUT the manager has a desperate Napoleon Syndrome. He told me that the bar was run independantly of the hotel. Sadly his attitude and behaviour let the whole hotel down. The worst of it is he's English, an embarrassing example of a fellow countryman.\nThe Spa - we didnt have a treatment but did venture down to the gym. It's small and the equipment is old and a couple were broken. not a patch on 'The London' gym.\n\nThe Ugly - english bar manager's attitude!!!
2393	August 13, 2012	I spent two nights at the Gansevoort on a weekend - when all taxes were added the total was close to 700 dollars.\n\nPositives:\n- Great attentive staff. They helped me to change to a room with a better view straight away, with a positive attitude\n- The bedsheets are to die for, extremely comfortable, silky and smooth - you can slide into them. Heavenly.\n- The hotel decor and lighting is sexy, although solo travelers like myself will probably not benefit so much from that as couples will\n- Beautiful rooftop\n- If you like to be in a constant party mood, this is a hotel for you - with all the lounges within the hotel, music and rooftop scene happening constantly, plus around all the Meatpacking District nightclubs\n\nNegatives:\n- Breakfast is not complimentary. And you're paying $300 a night. Even cheaper hotels will compliment their guests with that...\n- Fitness center could be better\n\nFinal conclusion: Great stay, but overpriced.\nI've been to the Plaza and the Palace, and trust me I know value. You will find places in NYC that are more stylish, offer better value (breakfast, other amenities), for the same money or less. In fact, in Soho you will find them for less money. And the New York Palace is practically on the same price level, but offers a lot more than this hotel does. That should be enough to make ya think!
2394	August 10, 2012	For a real first experience of NYC this hotel was amazing! From the staff to the views to the cleanliness and personal assistance for anything!Perfect for children also, has everything you need all in one building!-EXCELLANT!!!!!!!
2533	March 8, 2012	First, I would like to say I have stayed at the Gansevoort hotel on Park Ave and the service and hotel there was phenomenal and I gave them 5 stars. This hotel just had bad service from the people working. They didn't open doors for you when you cam. And an incident we had was we wanted to get a cab and the doorman told us to go outside and get one.i guess it was too cold outside for him. But it took us like 30 minutes before we could even catch a cab at meat packing. The staff is Horrrible!, except on the last day when we were leaving, the doorman Omar was very helpful, he opened the door for us. Helped us with the luggage and got us a taxi. Furthermore, I cannot recommend this hotel as I received poor service.
2400	August 7, 2012	Was expecting a lot more out of our visit to this hotel after speaking with representive who talked me into staying I was told my stay would be nothing less than exceptional as far as location amenities and service were concerned.Just what I was looking for to help make our 14 year anniversary special ,my parents afforded us the opportunity to have a quick getaway to celebrate .\nUpon checking in I asked for a king room as they are based on request only basis ,the front desk graciously assigned us a king .However I was given a smoking king very stinky and I have many allergies did not realize I had to specify no smoking!Called front desk with my concerns and was told the only way I could change rooms and still have king was to pay 40 dollars more because only queens were left in my category .So I paid the 40 dollars to be able to have king because desk clerk said her manager was unwilling to upgrade .I didn't feel my request was unreasonable just wanted a nonsmoking king.Any way room was nice and a little roomier for the 40 dollars would have been fine except room temperature was warm it was very hot day we stayed.At first we assumed it was because it was so hot out it could not catch up turned it as far down as it could go went out to see some sights came back still only 75.Called desk maintence came up and agreed it was not working properly he said he would look at it.We went out for dinner and returned to find it still not working to capacity still at 75 by this time it's getting late we were told if we were not happy with it we could move to a QUEEN room seriously?at 11 at Night no thanks it was a sleepless night to say the least hot and noisy our room that I paid to upgrade was on 3 rd floor in front of hotel lobby, night club crowd is loud!Oh well you don't get what you pay for here.Good points are location and rooftop pool and staff was very friendly, food at pool is good and waitress's are great!Beautiful pool views that part definately is worth the price of admission ! Like a previous reviewer stated rooms may be nice if know what ones to ask for I guess?
2401	August 6, 2012	We stayed at the Hotel Gansevoort for 3 nights with our 4 year old daughter. I can't say enough good things about this hotel. From the moment we checked in (early) to the moment we checked out they were unbelievable. The view from the Rooftop pool/bar was fantastic - and having the Rooftop pool was a HUGE plus for us with a 4 year old. it does close early (for family swimming) but this wasn't ever an issue for us. On our first day there the guy that was "manning" the pool area brought out freezies for the kids (and parents) and it was such a nice thing to do, we were all in shock. We were pretty much the only people up there (it was overcast) and the fact that he went the extra mile was so much appreciated. The door/elevator staff were BEYOND great with the kids. They were always betting with them about which elevator would come first, and didn't ever roll their eyes when the kids insisted on taking the turn style door instead of the regular one. We had a meeting at the rooftop bar the one night as part of a contest win, and the staff at the bar were excellent - they went out of their way to make our daughter feel at home, even made her a Shirley Temple. They also didn't get upset when we took the kids out to the balcony to see the sunset and take a few photos. I didn't ever ONCE get the feeling that we were a burden because we had a child. Even the people partying at the bar were super friendly with the kids. I was shocked. The rooms are super clean, and the beds are ridiculously comfortable. The location was fantastic - with lots of great places to eat/see in the area. Highly recommend the diner on the corner, and also getting food at the Chelsea Market was really convenient. I would stay at this hotel again in a heartbeat.
2402	August 4, 2012	This really is the happening place in the city these days so reserve well in advance. The price is typical of upscale Manhattan hotels, but a corporate rate may come through if you telephone reservations? You'll love the bar and will probably have a "star sighting" there. The rooms are modern and plush. The location will certainly save you some taxi fares. Grab your Louis and Gucci and go.
2403	August 3, 2012	we spent 4 nights with our 2 children (7&9) at hotel Gansevoort and mainly chose the hotel because of its great location in the Meatpacking district and because of its rooftop pool as we thought the pool would be a nice to take the kids to after sightseeing or when they got fed up with sightseeing. The hotel and rooms are great, particularly the house keepers are fantastic (with 4 people in a relatively small room it was very helpful to have housekeeping twice a day). We had a room on 10th floor with great water views. The rooms are nice and a bit funky! It was relatively quiet but for Saturday night where nightlife in the Meatpacking districts restaurants in front of the hotels were at it's highest. Sleep was definitely disturbed by honking cars, people and police sirens on the other hand you don't get any closer to the action, but maybe not ideal for a family. Same thing goes for the pool and bar on the rooftop. It is such a party place and in that respect super fun but not really a place for kids. Pool area is for hotel guests only though. You also get busy traffic to the bar with the lifts. The bar is not a very attractive place as it smells badly of drinking place (spilled beer etc), which is a bit strange that it can't be cleaned away.It's crowded with people though. We used the fitness centre on site and it was adequate but nothing special as it is in the basement in a small room. If the hotel guests had been fitness oriented it could have been too small but there was only 1-2 other people when we used it daily. One treadmill was not functioning and both seemed of an older date. There were classes (yoga) in an adjoining spacious gym which seemed to cater for people from the public, but it was possible to join in.
2404	July 30, 2012	I stayed at the Gansvoort in April 2012, and have been wanting to write a review since! The hotel has a very chic ambience and one feels pretty special just walking in when others have to queue up to get inside. I stayed there for a week with my cousin and absolutely enjoyed myself. The location is perfect. Some of the best restaurants in town are right around here, buddakan, pastis, spice market. not to mention chelsea market is a stones throw away.. the nightlife is brilliant.. the hotel staff are exceedingly accommodating, esp the front desk and concierge. They will help you out with ANYTHING. My cousin ran out of contact lens solution one very late weekend night, and the staff offered to pop into the nearest 24hr drugstore to get it for us.. Much appreciated. We also happened to be staying at the Gansvoort a time when a very famous celebrity family were also their guests.. I never felt like we were a less of a priority than them and thats saying a lot.. Have to specifically mention the manager at the hotel who was very very accommodating at a time when the hotel was all booked up and we needed to extend our stay.. All in all a great experience. Id definitely stay here again. there is one con though.. the room i stayed in had a huge wallpaper of a guy sitting on a chair.. kinda creeped us out at night when the lights were off.. also, kinda noisy in the morning with all the delivery trucks.
2410	July 27, 2012	Great position if you like things a little quieter. Close to world class restaraunts and walking distance to great spots like soho, the highline,Chelsea Market, the subway and times square. Very comfortable hotel with great service and facilities. Can get a little busy in the lobby and on the rooftop pool bar, but security looks after the hotel guests and the noise did not affect us in the room. Highly recommend for your next stay.
2411	July 26, 2012	Great location and a real scene............you will be treated nicely and its a great homebase for a NYC weekend in the meatpacking district, which is very trendy and hot right now. If you are into star sightings, this is the place...............the rooftop pool is small but during the days you will have little problem setting up. the view fro the rooftop lounge is awesome. location, location, location.............
2412	July 24, 2012	Most of the staff were unfriendly and some extremely rude. New Yorker who checked in on July 4th and was deeply disappointed. This is not the same hotel I spent my birthday back in 2007. Definitely not the same Plunge & not the same GSPA. Its become a haven for trash and has declined immensely. The person cleaning up the pool area was extremely rude when he grabbed my arm trying to prevent me from collecting my charger. I asked politely, but instead was accosted. I simply wanted to collect my charger which I left by the pool during the fireworks. For a guest paying $600/nite, I was highly disappointed to be treated in that manner. Like I said, the place has gone downhill. Hospitality they are no longer known for & it seems they now hire trash. Go elsewhere. Never again.\n\nThe room (suite) was a good size, but not worth it. For a hotel this size & in this city - you would think its sound proof.
2413	July 21, 2012	I always expect a bit of attitude when I'm in the meat packing district, but this place exceeds. The roof top bar (Plunge) and its adjoining swimming pool affords nice views of the city, but the place swarms with the urgently hip on the weekends, making good time hard to to come by. Prices are what you'd expect for this part of the city, with attitude to match. Good for people watching, but that's about it.
2414	July 21, 2012	I'm a New Yorker living on the UES and stayed here over the July 4th weekend in order to watch the fireworks from the pool deck. The standard room was quite small which I can accept given the location. I didn't like how some things in the room had prices on them and some didn't. There were about 3 bottles of water on the side table, one was about $8.50, the others didn't say.. shaving kit in bathroom had a $15 price sticker.. other things didn't.. this cheapened the experience a bit. Also there was only 1 bathrobe in the cupboard but 2 of everything else. Made me wonder if I would get stung the $159 they charge if you stuff one in your suitcase. The shower also caused the whole bathroom floor to get wet. Otherwise bed was very comfortable, air con very cold, free wifi, and the shampoo/conditioner good quality.\n\nWhat really annoyed me was the number of babies and children in the pool. I assumed this was a swanky, yuppy hotel- I didn't expect it to be so over run by families. It made relaxing in the lovely but small rooftop pool difficult. I understand they can't say no to families but I'm just surprised they would choose to stay here. Oh and during the fireworks non-hotel guests who were in the bar area migrated to the pool area (which is supposed to be guests only) and the best viewing spots by the pool were reserved for people ordering bottle service.\n\nAlso there are 3 elevators but it can be really slow getting to your floor when the bar is busy- would be nice if there was a dedicated hotel only elevator.\n\nOverall it was a good stay but for the price I would have expected at least a chocolate on the pillow (without an additional price tag attached). A free breakfast wouldn't go astray either..
2420	July 16, 2012	Wanted to splurge on something special for my boyfriends 40th birthday so I booked a Saturday night stay at the Gansevoort in the middle of July. The location was perfect for the party weekend we had planned and I was hoping to take advantage of the roof top pool. The hotel staff was was friendly and showed professionalism. The room is a bit over the top...."look at me I am hip and cool" photos remind you that this is where the cool people stay (in case you forgot). Ok ok, I GET it. There was terrible lighting (see "things old people say Chapter 3") and we could have used another outlet but the BED was possibly the MOST COMFORTABLE bed I have EVER SLEPT IN!!!! The Plunge Bar was filled with frat boys but the view was gorgeous. My $20 glass of champagne was horrible but we choked it down, took some photos and enjoyed the moment. This place is a party all day and night. When we got back after dinner, the streets surrounding the hotel were packed with people (at 1am!) and we popped into TOY for a nightcap. Although it was incredibly crowded, the conscientious staff seemed to have everything under control and hotel guests were given priority and courtesy. Look....this is a PRICEY hotel but it is a real NYC experience. The morning after our big night out, we walked the High Line and had a refreshing dip in the hotel pool. Very glamorous....maybe E! will pick up my reality show after all??
2421	July 12, 2012	My wife and I stayed one night last week for a couple's get away. We were not able to take advantage of the benefits of the location as we had plans but it's familiar ground. We spent some time at the roof bar/pool. It's a nice spot to have a drink and the scene at the pool was entertaining. The room itself was very average I thought. There was nothing wring with it, although it did seem to smell vaguely of smoke, but it wasn't special in any way.\n\nIf you are visiting NYC from out of town I could see this being a good choice. It's close to some good restaurants, the village, the Highline and it has novelty value with the roof pool, just don't expect the rest of the hotel itself to be all that exciting. For us it was just fine, and I was ok with that since the cost of the room was pretty middle of the road too.
2422	July 11, 2012	I stayed with my girlfriend at the Gansevoort for one night about a month ago. I was treated very well from the beginning to the end all thanks to the staff. I was given a free upgrade to the 12th floor at check in and when entering my room (with a lovely view of the Hudson River) I was delighted to see a full bottle of red wine as a gift. After spending the afternoon by the pool, we had to see the night life of Meat Packing and of course the overnight staff took care of us. Mitchell working at the front desk is one of a kind, he made sure that we had everything we needed and more. Gansevoort I will be back! See you soon!
2423	July 9, 2012	Travelled to NYC for long weekend to celebrate big birthday with my friend. Fantastic location, rooms are a good size, rooftop bar atmosphere & views amazing. Great base in lively area. Would definitely return
2444	June 13, 2012	I just completed a great week long stay at this property. As someone who frequents NYC on a monthly basis for business, i can honestly say that this location will now be added to my repertoire of fantastic hotels south of midtown.\n\nThe staff was very attentive, and always on hand each morning to help me flag down a cab during rush hour. I never had to wait for more than a minute or so...and at 8am, no less.\nAlso- this hotel can get very busy at night, with the great bar on the roof, and yet at the same time, the staff made me feel welcome as I breezed past the roped off area and into elevators on my way to my room after a long day or work and dinners.\n\nI do enjoy god in room amenities, and both the hard and soft product were great. One feature, I really did appreciate, was that the mini-bar was packed full of goodies, but not overstuffed- allowing me to bring home a half open bottle of wine from dinner one night, without needing a degree in geometry to find space.\n\nDownstairs gym and workout area were well appointed, and the extra space for abs and yoga was great to have during staffed hours. As an early riser- it was nice to see not very many people using the facilities around 6a,\n\nFree Wifi throughout the hotel was nice- and very fast. I was able to run both my iPad and phone without an issue.\n\nI will definitely return to this hotel soon.
2424	July 8, 2012	Just returned from celebrating an anniversary in town...just wanted to get away for the night so hopped on the subway to go to this hotel. I'd been here for parties before for parties but never stayed the night.\nUpon arrival, were told by the employee at the front desk that the room we reserved would not be available (a gansevoort suite on the smoking floor), even though I had called the day before to ensure the room would be available, and was assured it was. The employee just kept stating 'its only a preference' over and over again. He was kimsd of bratty about the whole was not apologetic, and did not offer anything to take the edge off. Instead of paying the exorbitant prices for a suite that I didn't want, we downgraded to a deluxe room. Turned out he had the gall to give us a room literally in front of the elevator when the hotel was easily more than half empty. Jerk.\nThe tv remote didn't work, but they sent someone to swap out an alternate quickly.\nOur bedroom was clean and cool but the bathroom floor was grungy. The fabled roof pool was a mess - patrons were throwing mojitos at one another in the pool - the employee probably could have handled it differently than just giggling. Had it not been 98 degrees we probably wouldn't have gone up as we've heard all the stories, but we needed to cool off. It's a great view, just unfortunate about the other patrons yelling and trashing the pool. I hadn't seen that many trucker hats in NYC in years.\nWe had room service twice. Breakfast and the fruit platter (with white and red wine gelatin cubes, yum!) were really good. The dinner entrees were adequate. They serve La Colombe coffee,\nmy favorite.\nSaturday evening they brought us a split of prosecco and some chocolates for our anniversay which was very nice.\nAll the staff with the exception of the individual at the front desk were really great, they all had a big smile and were willing to help.\nThe hotel is not for everyone - it's young, has a party atmosphere especially on weekends, and some of the other clientele dont really care if they're ruining it for everyone else. It's unfortunate. Next time I think we'll try the Standard.
2430	June 30, 2012	Is the first time i visit the hotel and really like it. The decoration is amazing but most of all the staff! We arrived late at night and at front desk Miquel really helped us with everything. He was really attentive and offered to help us with turistic information, It is really valuable to be received fby people like this that is always willing to help and most of all when is your first time in the area. At the second day he remembered us and ask how was our day and he looked interested in our opinion towards the hotel and services.\nI recommend this hotel for young couples you will really enjoy the style and area! is worth the price!
2431	June 30, 2012	Like all many great places Hotel Gansevoort has become tired...and overrun with trendy wannabees. It used to be that you could stay here and quietly sit by the pool with euro business folk, a few Japanese tourists, and maybe a celeb. Now the rooftop looks like a scene from MTv's Jersey Shore...I am not exaggerating...there is serious Jersey Shore testerone and Long Island accents (yea, Jersey and LI accents are equal in my ear). The rooms are showing wear and the staff service - while trying to be white glove - has just become a little bit slack.\n\nLame.
2432	June 27, 2012	Took my little sister and a bunch of her friends there to celebrate her birthday. She and her friends absolutely loved. We got a Manhattan suite connected with a deluxe double and the layout worked perfectly. We used the living room as a gathering place to cut the cake and chill out after a long day of eating/exploring/shopping...\n\nThe hotel is in the heart of the meatpacking district and has that perfect "cool" vibe we were looking for. The girls absolutely loved their time at the hotel, especially upstairs at the rooftop pool. Our only complain was that the "heated pool" was Frigid!\n\nThe hotel staff are very friendly and even humorous and make sure your stay is pleasant. The spa is underwhelming but it was enough to keep the girls entertained.... Overall, the Hotel Gansevoort is a great place for those seeking to live the "hip/trendy" city life, if even for a day or two.
2433	June 24, 2012	This hotel is the worst I have ever stayed in.. The art inside the rooms is beyond infantile and is almost offensive.. The staff are supercilious and the food is terrible.. And the prices are bizarre..
2434	June 21, 2012	The Gansevoort hotel in the former meatpacking district of New York is apparently a happening place but we found the service less than great. Arrived at 2:00pm for a reserved room and told that room was being made-up and would be ready shortly. Two hours (!) later after many excuses (and two drink vouchers to buy off our increasing impatience), we finally got into the room. The decor (including shower curtain) follows the motif of large-scale glossy magazine ads that you might find for alcohol or perfume products. Will stay elsewhere next time.
2440	June 20, 2012	My wife and I went to college in manhattan and work in NYC. After 17 years we bought a house on Long Island near the beach. We decided to do a weekend Baby Moon for our second child a few weeks ago. We had the greatest time. We visited the places we met and started dating at but mostly we relaxed and basked in all the comforts of the Gansevoort meatingpacking NYC. The staff was kind courteous and helpful. We swam in the pool, worked out in the Gym and ate at all our favorite places in the area. I can't recommend a hotel any higher. try it you'll love it.
2441	June 18, 2012	I had an excellent stay and experience at Hotel Gansevoort. Aside from the perfect location in the heart of Meatpacking District and an awesome rooftop pool, the Hotel guest services and accommodations were exceptional. The rooms are spacious and clean. The Hotel management team was effective and efficient and went out of their way to make sure my stay was stress free. A runner named Omar even helped me take care of a shoe mishap over the weekend. I am an avid traveler, and I can honestly say that this is one of the best and most fun hotels I have ever stayed at. Most highly recommended.
2442	June 16, 2012	The staff at Gansevoort in the Meatpacking District was almost overly friendly. The staff made me and my middle class girlfriend from the Midwest feel like VIP's. I highly recommend this location for young socialites.
2443	June 14, 2012	I was visiting my daughter for a couple of days and we had a wonderful time. We stayed together and were very comfortable in our room. I was concerned it might be noisy because of the rooftop bar on the top floor but it was not noisy at all. We had drinks both nights outside in the curbside restaurant tables and that was just perfect for us. Everyone was very efficient and nice and clearly available to help with anything we needed. The only thing to mention to the hotel is that the airconditioning is kind of loud. The location was great for us. It is walking distance to many delicious restaurants. I will absolutely stay there in the future whenever I visit my daughter who lives around the corner.
2450	June 12, 2012	Our experience at this hotel was amazing. The hotel was beautiful, clean and the perfect location for our trip into NYC. Our room was on the 11th floor, with a view of the Hudson river that was gorgeous. The rooftop bar was something that everyone should experience. The drinks were worth the price since they don't skimp on the liquor. We ordered room service for breakfast and it was hot when it arrived and delicious. We also liked that we were able to specify the time that we wanted the food to arrive, and that was precisely when our food did arrive. We cannot wait to come back for another stay at Hotel Gansevoort.
2451	June 11, 2012	We stayed in the meatpacking district hotel for 3 nights in May 2012. Our stay was distinctly underwhelming - over-priced and lacking in customer service.\n\nThe hotel's primary concern is not its customers but the young crowds that pitch up from dusk to go up to the rooftop bar. You have to queue up with them and show your room card before you can get into the hotel.\n\nDuring our stay the hotel's restaurant was closed for renovation. Breakfast in your room was obligatory as was the 22% additional tax/delivery charge. To have two coffees in your room cost nearly US$30.\n\nOne night I tried to reserve a table in the roof top bar for supper. I made it clear that I was guest of the hotel but was told by the bar manager that they could only reserve a table if we committed to buy a US$175 bottle of champagne. We went else-where.\n\nLastly, it transpires that the hotel did not merely "authorise" our credit card when we checked in; they actually took the money off it to the tune of US$ 2000.00. A fact which was never communicated to us. We paid the final bill using a different bank card and it was only when our credit card was rejected because we were "over our limit" that we realised that Gansevoort had single-handedly helped themselves to another US$ 2000.00 or so. We went back to complain. Standard procedure we were told. The excess funds would be returned back within 5 business days.\n\nWe won't be staying in another Hotel Gansevoort again.
2452	June 5, 2012	First of all the location of this hotel is perfect - Meat Packing district is really great part of the city to stay in.\n\nRooms are a great size.\n\nRoof top bar was really busy but the service was good, the bar was being really well managed.\n\nConcierge service in reception made some good restaurant recommendations.\n\nWould recommend and will stay again when I'm back in the city.
2453	June 2, 2012	Dark tunnel-like hallways, chrome and glass and unfortunate colors passing for sophistication, rooms not ready when or as promised, bad service, and generally overpriced and understaffed.\n\nLet's not forget the high-traffic, tiny lobby with shop-worn furniture and too much noise. In fact, the street outside is quieter and more pleasant.\n\nToo harsh you say. Ok, the sheets and pillows were first quality, the mango in the little sidewalk cafe was a surprise, and the valet staff was quick. End of list.\n\nThe Ganesvoort bills itself as an "urban resort". What nonsense. The name is Hotel Gansevoort, and this is just not a good hotel. First things first, please.
2454	May 30, 2012	Its the second time that I stay in the Gansevoort.\nEverything was fantastic. I love your rooftop bar and pool. The service was excellent.\nI would like to thank Luisa at the front desk for all her help. She was always very helpful and professional. I will be back in november next year... I hope everything is the same.
2460	May 26, 2012	I just returned from a weekend at the Gansevoort and can't say how incredible our stay was! We were a party of three 'middle'aged' females who went down to see Rock of Ages and spend the night in NYC and, of course, Gansevoort was my choice since I have stayed there many times before during the last few years and it was never a disappointment--far from it! In any case, the three of us started our day enjoying the lovely view from the penthouse/pool area with a bottle champagne until the room was ready--which it was, shortly after we arrived. After a quick lunch during our stroll in this beautiful part of NYC we got into the room and really enjoyed the cool features--a wonderful, comfortable bed, pull-out sofa bed, hi-tech stereo/ipod system, great flat screen TV, and a beautiful closet, bathroom, etc.\nIt was overall another incredible weekend at a great hotel, but outside of the fact that the accommodations are wonderful, it is the staff that makes me return--usually several times a year! I have never had a problem that could not be solved by Ms. Jennifer Wheeler, and I've never had to worry about my luggage thanks to John, the valet who greets everyone with a smile and will go above and beyond to ensure that your stay is wonderful!\nIn response to comments that the Gansevoort can be loud in the evening due to the parties on the rooftop--that is true! But never once did the noise interfere with our stay. Actually, once we left the rooftop club, which is a very cool place (even for older people!), none of us ever heard any noise at all. Once we sank into those comfortable Gansevoort beds, we all slept great!\nBTW--definitely love the room service also. The food, and the waitstaff, are great! Can't wait to return next month for another mini-vacation, and thank you all for making our last stay so perfect!!
2461	May 25, 2012	If you are looking for poore breakfast buffet in the Lobby, cleaning next to you during breakfast, noisy nights and a management that does not care about - then you are right @ The Gansevoort! All these points I told the front desk and a member of the management. I even asked for a member of the direction - with no success. For sure,I will never ever be back in this absolute desert of customer service.
2462	May 23, 2012	We had an amazing stay at Gansevoort in the meatpacking district.\n\nThis is THE place to be if you want to have fun.. we did.. a lot of fun. Location is prime, surrounded by the best of NYC's night life and top restaurants.\n\nThe rooms were great, rooftop pool/bar even better. Best part is that the pool is exclusive to guests only. It was awesome taking a swim and then seeing that view..\n\nThe staff were very nice. Bartenders were ok. Front desk was great. Benjamin was very nice and helpful, and always smiling. The doormen were also very good, very attentive even though they seemed extremely busy.\n\nThe one bad thing about our trip was that the restaurant was closed.. I think because of construction, we'll have to try it next time.\n\nOverall, it was definitely worth it, we'll be back!
2463	May 22, 2012	The service and emploers were so nice...The rooftop was awesome........The rooms were very clean and set up totally.......
2483	May 8, 2012	Bear with me - this is my first review.\n\nMy wife and I visited NYC for a celebratory 4-night weekend. Having stayed in Times Square various times before, we wanted to stay somewhere different, away from the tourist masses. We picked the meatpacking district because of the easy access to all areas via subway and particularly to be in walking distance of West Village.\n\nThe rooms are nice and I liked the different, can I say funky/modern (?) decor though I still say we paid over the odds for the size of room. As we had a special reason to celebrate, a bottle of champagne was delivered to our room on the first night (though we were too tired to drink it).\n\nThe staff were helpful when pressed and while I wouldn't say it was an overly friendly atmostphere as you go through the lobby, I don't really have room for complaint. What I did like was the prompt response to questions that we got back from the concierge when completing the initial booking.\n\nI had read with concern previous reviews about it being overly noisy from either the lobby or rooftop bars. I have to say, I didn't notice this - and indeed, there was a buzz that made hotel life quite attractive, especially when having drinks at the rooftop bar (though you once again pay for the location).\n\nThe only strange thing we found is the lack of a "do not disturb" sign. Instead, you have to leave your key card in the front of the door to signify you want privacy, which I wasn't really that comfortable with. What was handy, was a weather report being left on the bed each afternoon.\n\nOverall, it was an excellent hotel experience and I'd stay there again, if I could find a better rate.
2464	May 20, 2012	Ganzevoort, Meatpacking has a reputation for being super trendy and the Meatpacking District is an exciting new area, by reputation. There are certainly a lot of restaurants and bars around, some pretty interesting shopping nearby and it is near the start of the Hi-Line walk (which is fantastic) but the hotel is tired. Has it partied too hard?\n\nIt certainly does party hard - stayed there for four nights and every night the place was busy from one party or another - fine if you're attending them but noisy and disturbing if you are just a guest staying in the hotel. The bar on the top floor is a really nice bar and on our first night we finished the day there with real pleasure - busy, buzzy, comfortable too and a great outlook. Each night after that we turned back as we approached because the music was club-loud and that is not a comfortable ambience for a late night bar.\n\nThe decor in the hotel shows all the signs of too much partying - a bit like your face the morning after: scuffed, saggy, a bit grimy, tired. Even the styling seemed better suited for the night before than the bright morning after. Curtains of plaited leather ropes and pierced cylindrical metal lampshades may look great, exciting even, in a dungeon but they strike an odd note in the street level foyer, especially when the reception desk was scratched and with flaky varnish (I may have imagined that but it was the impression that it created, and that's not good) - like a cheap motel.\n\nThe service in the hotel was hit and miss too - generally the more junior the member of staff the more enthusiastic it seemed to be but generally it lacked polish or style. Breakfast was so dreary, bad even, that we just gave up and went across the road to Pastis which was good and definitely worth looking forward to.\n\nSpent a lot of money staying at this hotel so I must find something good to say about it. We were given a room upgrade and the room was a good size and comfortable and that we appreciated - couldn't finish our evenings in the bar after all. The shower had good pressure and a door that really worked and kept the bathroom dry - given the number that do not, this must be much more difficult that it seems\n\nAnd there was one thing that was first class - the free wi-fi - none of that aggravating daily password stuff or (a deplorable practice of many expensive hotels) charging a high additional rate for it. It was free, it was easy to use and the coverage was good: can't ask for more of the wi-fi in an upscale hotel and that they really did get right.
2470	May 16, 2012	Stayed there for my 40th birthday and was disappointed as was expecting great things- pool was so cold we couldn't venture in there were loads of people who just came in the hotel the poolside bar and the noise outside was unbearable! Breakfast choice was poor but the staff were excellent
2471	May 16, 2012	The hotel is good for a night out in the city. Great location and overall good service. A few issues but it would be the same with any hotel like this.
2472	May 15, 2012	I normally don't write reviews but for Gansevoort, it's an exception. I've been to many upscale hotels, but Gansevoort stands out by far, especially in New York City. Now just because you pay a high price a night does not mean it will always be the best. However, in most cases the rooms will meet a certain standard at these upscale hotels. So I'm never really concerned about that. What I am concerned about is customer service and the staff attitude. I have to say Gansevoort has to be one of the best. I was once a co owner of a restaurant, and always believed that managed had an enormous effect on the staff. In saying this, the manger at Gansevoort, Mr. Benjamin, was exceptional.(Any questions I asked or requests that I made were given with a response with full respect and most importantly were really helpful with helpfully tips about all best spots to eat and party in NYC) This is no wonder that his attitude and behavior reflects on to his staff because they were all superb. Which I must say is the foundation to a nice and clean hotel that I would from now on stay when visiting the Big Apple. (if the price permits of course) which I wont be too worried about.
2473	May 15, 2012	My husband and I spent a week in the Gansevoort in Lower Manhattan. Really nice and a fantastic location. The staff are helpful and friendly. Loads of restaurants and a great beer garden nearby!
2474	May 12, 2012	Excellent location, very friendly staff. Nice size room. However difficult to sleep as it is so noisy. Had a street facing room and it felt like the nightclub was in my bedroom. Finally settled at 5am. Good if you want to party all night but otherwise dont expect to get much rest.\nAlso awful experience in the restaurant in the lobby (not sure if it is associated with the hotel) but Ive never seen slower service. I had to ask for the menu 3 times and then wait 30 minutes for the bill after asking several times. It was chaos with the wrong orders coming out constantly to most people around me. Im not sure if the staff or the restaurant is new but it has a lot of problems. Again not a fault of the hotel staff who were always very helpful.\nI also tried Exhale Spa within the hotel and the massage was amazing! HIghly recommend.
2480	May 11, 2012	My sister and a I went to nyc for my birthday weekend and had the most amazing time there! We showed up and checked in and everyone was so nice. 15 minutes after we settled in someone knocked on our door and the hotel had sent up chocolates and a bottle of champagne as a birthday gift! The rooftop was amazing and it was the perfect location for nightlife and restuarants. The staff went above and beyond the whole stay especially Cem and the night manager JP. Will def be staying there again next time I'm in NYC.
2481	May 9, 2012	I have always stayed in midtown when I visit NYC. I changed things up this time and chose hotel gansevoort. Needless to say, now I am hooked. Being in a posh section of the city, also safe was a wonderful change from touristy midtown. The hotel is a gem with an awesome rooftop pool and view. The staff is top noch, with excellent attitudes towards the guests. I never heard the word "no" from anyone I requested something from. Just overall an amazing experience. Will be making plans to stay here again.
2482	May 9, 2012	I rented out one of the suites this past weekend for a bachelorette party. And unfortunately, because I tried to return back to hotel with my guests with only one key to the room, I was given I really hard time.\nSix of us were staying overnight in the suite, and we were given two keys. Unfortunately, only one of us carried a key with us out of the room so that we could go to dinner. And upon arrival back to the hotel. We were stopped by the doorman who questioned why we (me + 10) only had one key. When I asked him if he wanted me to go up and grab the other key, he questioned my intentions and called out the manager.\nThe manager wasn't any better. He questioned whether or not I was actually a guest in the hotel, and threatened that if me and my guests WERE to get any noise complaints that he would kick us out or charge us for all the extra people.\nI found this to be VERY offensive. I would understand if we were being obnoxious, but we simply wanted to return to our hotel after dinner so that we could get ready to go back out and celebrate with the bride.\nI did not expect to be treated so poorly in a 5 star hotel. Or that the manager would lack such suave.
2484	May 7, 2012	Charismatic room, great loft bar beside the pool, good restaurant, very nice service.\nThe spa is not recommandable, average massage and so so facilities. Overall it is rather noisy.
2490	May 7, 2012	Great position, right in the meat packing district, very happening area, the hotel staff are fine, the rooms are tiny, the bedroom could do with some drawers, left most of my clothes in my case, no drawers? The bathroom is also very small, I expect more from a 5 star hotel, how can it have the same star ratting as say the Pierre?
2491	May 5, 2012	The hotel arranged a driver who picked me up from JFK with a town car.\nI stayed here for two weeks in on of their bigger rooms on 10th floor facing the Hudson river.\nThe room had a comfy bed and a couch directly near the window with great views down the busy street and Hudson. It also comes with a really nice and spacious bathroom which I loved!\nStaff was really friendly and helpful.\nI ordered a lot from the in room dining menu which has a couple of good options but could offer more choice.\nIts location in the meatpacking district is ideal for for people aged 20 to 40 I'd say. There are a couple of clubs(e.g. Cielo) and restaurants just 2 min away. For proper shopping you will have to walk a bit or take a cab but they a rather cheap in NYC anyways.\nFor you party people: there is a nice rooftop bar on 14th floor which gets quite packed on weekends. The good thing is, as a hotel guest you dont have to queue up in the main lobby to access the bar, you can just take the lift and come and go whenever you want. Also on 14th floor: rooftop pool.\n\nI really enjoyed my stay but it is probably a bit pricey if you stay for longer than a couple of days.
2492	May 1, 2012	This was a trendy hotel in the meatpacking district but is pretty pricey. The rooms were minimalistically decorated but with a comfortable feel but be aware that there is a bar/pool on the top floor. If you are trying to get a peaceful nights sleep on the weekends, this is not where you want to stay as the place gets noisy with patrons going upstairs. Good for hotel guests as they do not charge to go up.\n\nThe reception and concierge staff was very helpful in directing us to different spots to visit throughout the day and even suggested their own favorites in the city whiich was a suprise and very welcomed. There was surely no signs of snobbish behavior as I've heard rumored from reading reviews of this place.\n\nGansevoort is in a great location to travel and explore in the neighborhoods around it with a group of friends for a short visit. No so much for a family environment but definitely a great spot for couples and singles.
2493	May 1, 2012	Let me start with saying - i have stayed at this hotel 6 times in the past two years. All sorts of rooms - from te basic entry level to the suites. They are very nice rooms. Not massive, but this is New York. I liked this hotel over The Standard as the people who worked there were more friendly and the service was better. Unfortunately I wont be staying here anymore. I was there during an unseasonably hot period in March. But the temperature in my room was 73f. I was told that there was nothing they could do as they hadnt turned the air con on for the summer yet. But they could give me a fan or i could open a window. I would have loved to open he window if (a) there wasnt a nightclub outside it or (b) there was not street noise....but this is the meatpacking district! Just not good enough really. I wont be back.
2494	April 30, 2012	ok, if you are planning a nyc with nightlife in meatpacking this is the hotel, close to pasti restaurant, a lot of bars, chease market, and with a apple store in next block, and with a great bar in the loft
2500	April 30, 2012	Great location, attentive staff, comfortable room. But noisy all night long - out in the street, which the hotel can't control - and inside the hotel, which they can. If you're here for business, you won't get much sleep. If you're here to party, this is the place.
2501	April 26, 2012	I was in the Gansevoort with my business associate for a few days, the rooms are gorgeous and the location is really good! I get the vibe that it is more for party than for business travelers but the staff is very helpful trying to make our stay as enjoyable as possible. Luiza from the front desk was extremely friendly and helpful always with a smile on her face! I will come back and recommend my friends to it!
2502	April 26, 2012	I liked the hotel. I also liked the staff and thought they were helpful and nice. However, I stayed two nights during the week and I can understand if this place tries too hard to be hip. I imagine during the weekend it could be quite noisy. The bar on the top floor was so freaking loud that I immediately left and had a drink in the lobby. For a NYC hotel, we got a good deal and walking the High Line was fun. If I wanted to pay more I would probably end up at the St. Regis or somewhere more high end.
2503	April 22, 2012	My husband and I enjoyed our stay. We had a nice room with great view. We felt a little too old to be staying here (53), but only because we weren't able to stay out partying past 2, when neighborhood was still quite lively. The rooms are modern and bathrooms great! We didn't really notice noise problems we saw others complain about. I did use spa and that was a little strange where was set up in the basement (small curtained room), but the treatment was excellent.
2504	April 17, 2012	My husband and I stayed here for what was supposed to be a Romantic weekend without the kids. Our stay was terrible. We stayed on the 6th Floor when we checked in at 3:00 it was nice and quiet. However, little did we know that at night a club opens up in the lobby so when we returned to the Hotel that night around 11:00 we were stopped by rude bouncers who almost didn't let us go our room. When we finally made it to our room it was so loud in our room from the club down below. There were people partying in the hallway. Needless t say I didn't sleep a wink, I came home exhausted. Do not stay here unless you want to party all night.
2510	April 12, 2012	My 1st room at the Gansevoort hotel meatpacking was not to my satisfaction and called down to Romy at the front desk for a better room and before i could return from starbucks my bags and new room keys were ready and waiting at front desk...Thanks to Romy you Rock!!!!
2511	April 10, 2012	Yes, great if you want to have late night, early morning noise disturbance from the "in crowd"\npartying on the rooftop, going up and down the hotel elevators and making sure all guests, trying to get the rest they paid for, know, the drunks want to share their fun with you.\nIt's incomprehensible a 4 1/2 Star at 5 star prizes would put guests through that ordeal, without any warning.\nThey should advertise as a 24/7 fun, party place for people who would like to avoid peace quiet and relaxation.\nThe comments on arrogant bouncers, screening every night time approach have been commented on enough as well as the poor state of repair of the rooms and size of the so called suites.\nTry to raise any of these issue with reception ? You''re definitely not cool enough to be considered a valuable guest, let alone to deserve a solution, such as relocation to a room away from the elevators, following three expensive nights with non- stop disturbance.
2531	March 17, 2012	As a world traveler I have had the opprotunity to stay in numerous hotels. I recently stayed at the Gansevoort hotel located in the meat packing disrltrict. Upon entering the hotel, we were greeted by a cheerful doorman, Omar. The front desk was quick and efficient regarding our checking into the hotel, thanks to Kim. Although we were very tempted to stay in our room due to its elegance, we decided to experiance Manhattan at its finest. A very charming security guard, Rashid, was very informative as to the emenities of the hotel and the hotspots in the city. The staff at the Gansevoort was extremely hospitable and made our stay an experiance to remember. I would not only reccomend this hotel but will bebreturning back to it as well.
2512	April 9, 2012	I (a 43 year old Swede) stayed for four nights in January with my 14-year old son in a grand deluxe twin room. We absolutely loved everything about Hotel Gansevoort! A very good location with walking distance to the High Line, Chelsea Market and a lot of nice restaurants – Del Posto, Waverly Inn etc. The room was medium size with two comfortable, huge beds and a little balcony with great view over the Meatpacking District and the Hudson River. Lovely large bathroom with a bathtub, a lot of space for your makeup products and perfect lightning – which I think can be a problem in many hotels. The hotel provides free WIFI, which I believe is not that common for hotels in Manhattan, but a must for us. We didn’t try the breakfast but instead had coffee, croissants and granola with fresh berries and Greek yogurt at the little café in the hotel, which was perfect. One morning I tried the rooftop pool which was open even if it was only 2+ C (36 F) outside. It was a crisp, sunny winters day and the water was just (luke) warm enough so I could swim for about 20 min. A wonderful experience and really refreshing! One morning I complained about some noise from the room above (due to some recarpeting) and later that day they sent me a nice bottle of wine and some delicious chocolate. That’s classy! A lot of other reviews have emphasized that the hotel is only suitable for the young and trendy crowd, but I don’t agree with that. I have stayed in many four and five star hotels in Europe and according to my opinion, a hotel’s greatness lies in the ability to treat all guests equally nice and polite and if they live up to that, it’s all that matters. I found ALL of the staff (receptionists, door men, waitresses and concierges) really kind and polite and I don’t think that was a coincidence. I highly recommend this hotel for everyone!
2513	April 5, 2012	The hotel is perfectly situated for all NYC hot spots. The suite was everything we hoped for and more. The staff at the front desk were professinal and friendly. We were made to feel like royalty, they opened doors for us, they spoke to us each day asking if everything was ok, the information regarding NYC we received was excellent. I cannot praise this hotel enough. I will definitely return and highly recommend it. A big Thanks to Matt for my NYC cookie.
2514	April 2, 2012	I travel a ton for work. I try to stay at the best hotels since my frim reimburses me. The service in this hotel was the best I have recieved in any hotel spanning my 25 years on Wall Street. The service even surpassed some hotels that were more much more expensive. I have never wrote a review before but felt this was the least I could after all they did for me.
2520	March 30, 2012	I arrived at hotel Gansevoort at about 2:30am one morning traveling from Boston to NYC by train. I had meetings in the morning and was only there for a quick trip. As I staggered into the hotel room (which was beautiful), I began unpacking my clothes for the next morning. Shoes, shirt, blazer, stockings, underclothes, jewelry....I quickly realized I forgot a vial piece of clothing for my meetings the next morning....my pants. In a panic, I dialed the front desk and told them my dilemma - I actually think I blurted it out and made little or no sense. However, that did not deter the Gansevoort staff. They said to give the 15 minutes and they would call me back. As I paced up and down the room, (which had a great view of the meatpacking district), I began picturing myself in my sweatpants and blazer presenting in front of a room of strangers in just a few hours. Right as my anxiety was at a max, the phone rang. JP, the night manager said that had found some old uniform pants and a few random pairs in my size that have recently been dry-cleaned - a member of the staff was on their way up. There was a knock on the door and a young woman with 4 pairs of freshly pressed black pants walked in. What kind of hotel does something like that? I had 4 pairs to choose from! It all worked out great in the end and the staff at Hotel Gansevoort will be forever in my debt. If you are going for business or pleasure - they will make sure your stay is perfect and memorable! I will be coming back – but with my own pants.
2521	March 29, 2012	My girlfriend and I returned from New York in mid March 2012 and stayed in the Gansevoort hotel for our stay 5 night stay. We had an amazing time and the hotel really made it for us.We were in New York in 2010 and stayed in the hotel too as really loved the location and night life.\n\nWe had an amazing time and would highly recommend the hotel now as all aspects were excellent, from the room to the staff. The staff at reception always knew our names, we were greeted every time they saw us and the gym and pool are fabulous. The outdoor pool has a great view of the city but thankfully is heated!\n\nClearly the hotel is under new management as the experience was far superior this time than our visit in 2010 - we definitely cant wait to go back to NY and to the Gansevoort again.\n\nGreat location and staff, the drinks on the roof were amazing - a hotel and experience to treat the other half to!
2522	March 29, 2012	Beautiful hotel, very nice rooms , a great roof top bar!
2523	March 25, 2012	Rooms are a little small, but great bathroom and view. However, what makes this hotel so unique and appealing is the location. There are about 30 awesome restaurants, bars, cafes, and offices within a 5 minute walk. The area has an almost electric atmosphere, even for NYC. After finishing up work, we had a drink at the bar downstairs and it's some of the best people watching around. Will definitely return to this hotel.
2524	March 24, 2012	I arrived at the Hotel Gansevoort on 9th Avenue around 4PM on March 20, 2012. My initial check-in experience was a little rough as the person seemed new. No problem, everyone starts somewhere. I get to my room and it was small. No problem, it's New York City. Then a loud humming sound goes... it's coming from all the roof top HVAC units right below me. I'm on the 5th floor... these things are humming... I'm here until Friday, I better go ask if they can move me. 2nd try with the reception desk, a woman tells me she has something at a higher floor and it's a king bed. Awesome. I waited for 45 minutes to 1 hour. It's 5:20PM now. I go back to the front desk and Jillian is there. She checks on it and tells me that house keeping is not responding. Instead of keeping all of this a mystery, she takes the initiative and tells me she is going to go check out the room personally and find out what is going on. Jillian cares! About 10 minutes later, she is back and tells me the room has a crack piece of glass and that engineering is there working on it. At about 6PM, I'm thinking, I need to check in... this process has taken too long. Jillian Beeman says, "thank you so much for your patience. I'm going to upgrade you immediately. This has taken way too long."\n\nThank you Jillian Beeman for going above and beyond the call of duty to ensure that I have a great stay. I did have a great stay because of your actions. You should be the example for the staff at Hotel Gansevoort.
2530	March 22, 2012	Cool vibe in the lobby because of the pool table & bar... front desk has the oddest Greek column in the middle; it should totally be removed as it doesn't belong there at all! Staff is ok,.... Stayed in a suite with a nice view but wasn't impressed with the room, too tiny, but that is usual in NY...\nI love its location and that is why I keep going back.
2540	February 29, 2012	My initial impression of the hotel was not great, but I was willing to keep an open mind. When I arrived, the doormen? came rushing over to the limo driver and asked if he can take a client to somewhere before I got out of the limo. The driver politely asked him to wait until our transaction was finished, but the guy kept on badgering him. To my surprise, there are no help with luggage, you roll your own luggage to check in.\n\nI'm curious if the bouncers and doorman are one and the same; if so, do they help guests with luggage? Upon departure, I had to ask the doormen to 'please open the door' for me while I rolled my own luggage out.\n\nOut of my 5 days stay and multiple taxi trips, I was offered help ONCE to get a taxi.\n\nThe room is overpriced compared to the services offered. The maids are on auto pilot; a few hooks from the bathroom curtain came off so I left it on the side of the tub, it was there for 3 days! Nothing was done, the curtain cannot close properly, I'm wondering if the hooks are still sitting on the side of the tub.\n\nI must say most of the workers are courteous, compared with other New York hotels in similar price category, this needs improvement.
2541	February 20, 2012	This hotel is currently a hot spot so we booked a 4 night stay here over a long weekend. On the second to last day we decided we wanted to stay another night. We went to the front desk and they set it up so we did not have to switch rooms. After we signed everything for the extra night a woman came over and said actually they have no rooms available. Finally, after arguing with her she came clean and said they did have available rooms but now we had to switch rooms. We were set to switch rooms at 12 pm, at 4:30, the room still wasnt ready. Overall, the service was not good and I'm not sure why there's so much buzz about this place.
2542	February 18, 2012	The lobby at the Hotel Gansevoort turns into a nightclub/bar scene at night- dark, loud music. This Hotel is in a great location for shopping and restaurants. We walked across the street for a great dinner at Pastis and another night had a nice meal around the corner at the Fig and Olive. The area is packed with crowds and limos at night. The staff is so so nice and seemed to go out of their way to make us feel welcome. I was traveling with my Mother as well as my 18 year old daughter. Our room was not big but fairly comfortable. My Mother and I were clearly the oldest people in the place.This is a great hotel for young people if they can afford it!
2543	February 11, 2012	I have a new favorite hotel in my home city of New York, and it is the Gansevoort in the so-called meatpacking district of New York. The staff could not be nicer and more welcoming. My wife and I live near the big city, but staying at the Gansvoort allows us to have a quick and easy mini vacation, especially with that heated pool on the roof top.\n\nWe liked it so much the first time we stayed that we booked it again the following weekend.
2544	February 8, 2012	I have been to the Gansevoort several times when I stay in New York City. Each time I stay I feel like my experience exceeds the next! Upon entering you are greeted with the nicest staff I have ever seen. We stayed in the Manhattan Suite last week and it was incredible! Since there was only 3 of us, we had a lot of room to move about in the suite.The suite had a nice space and I felt comfortable the second I walked in.It helped that there were 2 bathrooms considering the time that women take to get ready! I was even checked in before 1pm, but since it is the city, you can always find something to do even if your room isn't ready yet. I was not expecting to have complimentary chocolates and a bottle of wine delivered to my room! The staff was very helpful when we couldn't figure out how to hook up the ipod to the dock to the stereo system. Honestly, we did not want to even leave the room because we were enjoying it so much, however the rooftop was calling our name! I love going up to Plunge! The atmosphere is very calm and I love the music that is being played as well as the view! Especially at night! I never noticed a sound problem in the lobby, the only time I heard the DJ was late at night around 10pm as I'm leaving and the lobby turns into a little bit of a lounge itself. I can not wait to return in March for my birthday, I am literally counting down the days!!!\n-Maggie
2550	February 3, 2012	I stayed at Hotel Gansevoort in July 2011 for two nights for business. Upon checking in, my room wasn't ready (even though it was 4:30 and check in time was 3pm) so I asked to use the business center, which was off of the lobby. The business center was fine, but at 5pm at DJ started playing music in the lobby by the bar (this was a Tuesday). After waiting for a room for over an hour, I finally was able to settle in.\n\nThe room I was in (a suite) was nice. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom was large and nice and the couch in the living room was comfortable to sit on. I ordered room service for dinner that night and the steak was very good and room service prompt.\n\nThe location of the hotel can't be beat. It only took me 30 minutes to get from La Guardia, has great cobblestone streets nearby and some good restaurants. Granted, I didn't get out much to explore since I was working, but I could see the location being a reason why someone vacationing would stay here.\n\nGenerally, my impression of the hotel is that it caters to a younger, vacationing, socializing crowd. The roof top pool and DJ in the lobby really benefit this type of crowd.\n\nOverall, I would not stay here again for work as it does not cater to the business crowd at all. If prices were a bit cheaper, I would consider it for a vacation hotel; however, I prefer more quiet surroundings so I would likely look elsewhere.
2551	February 3, 2012	This past Saturday I had the pleasure of obtaining a Manhattan suite for a little mini-vacation to break up the tedium of the winter. My daughter and her two friends, all in their early 20s, wanted a night out in the city and always prefer the Gansevoort as they really love dancing at the rooftop bar! Of course, we also love staying there because the service is excellent and the room service is good also! While we usually book a deluxe room with a small balcony, we had received an upgrade to a Manhattan Suite thanks to a manager who was most accommodating--Ms. Jennifer Wheeler. Upon check-in were were greated by John, one of the friendliest valets you would ever want to meet. Since we arrived quite early, approximately 11:00 a.m., the room was not yet ready but was in the process of being cleaned and upon return from breakfast, it was ready. The girls were impressed with the suite which has a living room, an extra half bath, a bedroom, and a full bath with a separate tub and steam shower. They were also impressed by the complimentary bottle of wine and the chocolates. The 13th street location is great and the girls had a good time visiting a few of the local clubs as well as the rooftop bar before retiring to the extremely comfortable bedding in the suite.\n\nUnlike some who have been in rooms that were said to be noisy, there was no noise at all inside the suite. However, depending on what floor you may be on, it is possible that you could get hear some of the music from the downstairs lobby bar or the rooftop pool although this has never been an issue for us as one of the main reasons we like the Gansevoort so much is because of the nightlife you can enjoy right on the premises. Typically the lines to the rooftop bar can stretch a good way down the block but if you are a guest you can take the elevator right on up and can get in without any problem.\n\nOnce again my thanks to the staff for providing the ladies with such an excellent weekend! We have already booked a room in March as my daughter plans to celebrate her 22nd birthday there. At this point, I can't think of any hotel that she would take over the Gansevoort and she has been lucky enough to experience a good many in the city. Thank you, Gansevoort staff, and we'll see you in March!
2552	February 1, 2012	Just returned from NYC and an overnight stay at the Gansevoort in the meat packing district.\n\nThe location is great - lots of shops, restaurants and easy access to the subway. The hotel offers valet parking for $40/night and it's about as reasonable as you will find in the area.\n\nThe staff at the hotel was exceptional - from the doorman to the front desk attendants and the housekeeping staff - they were friendly and attentive and the service was great.\n\nMy only complaint was the noise - inside and outside of the hotel. We were on the 6th floor facing west (9th Ave). I woke up at 1 AM to the sounds of a fight in the hallway. Security responded after being called but the commotion continued for about a half hour. Once that was resolved the traffic noise started - and from 2 AM to 4 AM it was like trying to sleep outdoors in Times Square. The street in front of the hotel (9th Ave.) is fairly quiet during the day - there's not a lot of traffic. The main activity on the street takes place when the bars start to close - there are massive traffic jams with cars trying to circle the block and beeping the horns continuously. The hotel could definitely use additional soundproofing.
2553	January 31, 2012	My wife and I live in Sydney Australia.\nSpent seven nights at the Gansevoort mid December.Spotless luxury room, great staff, excellent service, best position in NYC. Room rates are so favourable my wife and I decided to return to this hotel after travelling over Christmas /New Year and spent another week here in early Jan. Had a reservation elsewhere but decided to return to the Gansevoort Meat Packaging District.\nNight life, bars, clubs, shops, restaurants, transport - all on tap.\n\nWill definitely be returning on my next trip to NYC in March 2012\n\nBest kept secret in NYC. Please do not tell too many Australians about this gem of a hotel.
2554	January 29, 2012	My family and I were very excited for our New Years Eve trip to NYC. I love Exhale and sushi both which are located here. The kids were thrilled; they love the city and when I told them I reserved Wii for the room they couldn't wait. These things mean a lot to a kid. It finally did arrived at 6:30 on our last night of our 4 night stay with dead batteries and with only one controller despite telling the front desk we had 2 kids. It took about 40 minutes and 2 maintenance visits to get up and running. The fact that the room had peeling wallpaper, frayed carpets, and no towels in the bathroom was just icing on the cake. Each morning we awoke to the smell of cigarette smoke (on a nonsmoking floor) and no promised daily newspaper. On 2 of the 4 nights the room wasn't cleaned until 5 PM. Honestly I hate complaining but it actually became comical. On January 2nd the room next door had a loud party until 4 AM! The hotel is very unlike other the sister Park Ave location which seems much nicer. So much for luxury.
2560	January 26, 2012	Going to keep this fairly short. Was at Gansevoort over new year and attended the nye party there!\nIdeally placed away from hustle and crowds of 5th avenue. In a very cool area with some great shopping.\nGood clean hotel that simply had an air of coolness about it! Pricey but that's good as keeps a certain standard of clientel.\nPool pretty chilly at 7am in winter!\nThank you Gansevoort!
2561	January 24, 2012	Had a wonderful stay. Everything was as I'd heard. Staff, room, entertainment were all excellent. Great location too. Will definitely be back.
2562	January 19, 2012	We thought the NYE party at Hotel Gansevoort would be a great way to celebrate. It disappointed on several fronts.\nWe had dinner there first, but the staff seemed like a bunch of chickens with their heads cut off. The dinner did eventually trickle through, and was superbly prepared, but the service and timing was so poor that it was hard to enjoy the dinner. It didn't help that they offered a choice of complementary champagne or vodka with dinner - since several tables went for the vodka and grew louder and more obnoxious by the second.\nThe ensuing party quickly degraded into a bunch of too drunk people puking, falling over and in one instance, not able to hold her bladder in the line for the washrooms. Maybe it's unfair to fully blame the hotel for attracting the wrong crowd but even if there hadn't been as many overly drunk guests, the evening would have still been less than acceptable because of the poor service.\nHopefully the staff are more capable in their daily hotel routines...
2563	January 18, 2012	My husband and I live nearby but decided to stay in the city one Friday night to attend a nearby work event. We were a bit hesitant to book here, fearing it might be one of the many "hip" hotels which were all attitude and no service. As it turns out, our fears were unwarranted. Upon check-in, I was greeted by a friendly bellman and front desk clerk, and soon shown to a room of the category we had booked (deluxe king). The room looked fine, with a decent view, but unfortunately smelled of smoke. I called the front desk, and was fortunate to reach Jacquelin (not sure of her title, but she was a complete professional in every respect), who apologized profusely, and promptly had a bellman come with a set of keys to a new room (which happened to be on a higher floor and farther from the elevator). No more smoke smell -- but as I am very sensitive to smells, this room unfortunately smelled more of air freshener than anything else. I was prepared to live with it, not wanting to make a fuss, when I received a call (from Jacquelin) asking whether the new room was satisfactory (impressive follow-up!). I confessed my sensitivity to the smell, and she said that she was just going to upgrade us to a suite, which should make us happy. Within minutes, she personally came to the room with the new keys (higher floor still...), escorted us to a gorgeous 1 br suite, complete with a bottle of proseco waiting for us in the ice bucket. she couldn't have been more apologetic for the inconvenience, and I could not have been more grateful for how it all worked out. She then gave us a brunch recommendation for the next day (great local place called Monument Lane) proceeded to make reservations for us, and we thought that would be that. But when we returned from dinner that night, we were personally and warmly greeted by Jacquelin, who escorted us to the rooftop bar and gave us two free drink tickets (what had we done to deserve all this?) We checked out the next day, leaving our luggage at the hotel when we went for brunch. While I was waiting in the lobby for our car, Jacquelin again greeted us, and wanted to be sure we enjoyed the restaurant she had suggested. All in all, we felt like her personal house guest. I've never had service such personal experience like that before, especially in a big city, relatively large downtown hotel. It's professionals like Jacquelin who help build brand loyalty. (For the record, we had spent 5 nights during the recent black out at the Gansevoort on Park Ave, and were ready to move in -- so much so that I just booked 3 nights with my daughter in Miami at the Gansevoort there!)\nOn a side note, the noise was not a problem at all (as other reviewers have complained), and we slept soundly until 11 a.m.! Great mini-getaway which we plan to repeat soon! Thanks, Jaquelin, for help making it a great escape!
2564	January 17, 2012	Yes, location of the hotel is good. But if you want to go sleeping, please try to avoid this hotel. I'm staying here and it's 2 am, but the music coming from outside is so loud that you feel you are in a club. Called frontdesk manager Jimmy. I was told that because of a bar close the hotel. The bar is not the hotel 's property and they cannot control them. Ok, I can understand the hotel cannot control their neighborhood, but why not equip soundproof window? If you like clubbing ang enjoy free club music in the night, this hotel is a good choice. For me, just want a room to sleep, I hope to move out as soon\nas possible!
2570	January 17, 2012	Before we moved uptown, in Manhattan's Upper East Side, we lived downtown and we sometimes itch to revisit our younger years. During those times, we take advantage of our 10 minute cab ride via the FDR to downtown and we regularly check into the Gansevoort Hotel in the Meatpacking district (3 blocks from our old apt)...it's the perfect way to refresh our soul and visit some of the "old joints." It's such a great getaway, we always walk away thankful for the experience. The rooms are well appointed (if you know which one to ask for...we have our favorite), the location is unbeatable (for shops, restaurants, clubs, lounges/bars), and the on-site premises are pretty awesome (including the rooftop pool, billiard room/loung on the main floor, and the rooftop bar/and on some nights club). As an added bonus, they allow pets if you have "little ones."\n\nWe love this place so much that we not only stay there several times a year for weekend staycations, when we want to gift our friends/family for special occasions, we reserve a night or two for them at the Gansevoort (which always proves to be a HUGE hit!).\n\nBecause of the location, the hotel attracts a somewhat "young" and "young at heart" party crowd (we are in our early to mid 30s), so if you are looking for a quite place (and trust me, sometimes we do), I would recommend Cooper Square on the East Side.
2571	January 16, 2012	Just back from the gansevoort meat packing with my wife. A two night stay in a deluxe room, fourth floor. The room was ok, reasonably sized for NYC, looking out onto the cobbled street.\n\nHowever, as other reviewers have written, the noise between 2am and c. 5am was the most unbelievable I have ever experienced in new York. Shouting, taxi horns (the streets are gridlocked at 4am as the bars and clubs are emptied out). This includes the gansevoort rooftop bar - we heard all the fourth floor people coming back to their rooms, and - so we discovered the following morning - other guests had to contend with loud music coming from adjacent bedrooms as some continued their after club partying.\n\nBasically the rooms have no soundproofing; the manageress admitted the hotel was built at a time when the area was not nearly as happening. As such we got no sleep at all (hardly ideal for the weekend in NY trip we'd been looking forward to). When we complained in the morning we were told that lots of guests complained about the noise, and that was it. No offer to compensate, no apology for omitting to mention on the website that this was not a hotel for anyone other than clubbers.\n\nIn other business the continental breakfast is poor (The diner across the road is excellent), and the bar at the standard is exceptional. You are probably better off staying there for the same price.\n\nAll in all, a rubbish stay and a grossly over rated hotelthat will only appeal to those who just want to beat the queues for the residents' bar or those with no intention to sleep. For the rest of us, don't bother. There are too many great hotels in NYC (Gramercy park, w union sq) to bother with this poop.
2572	January 15, 2012	Stayed at the Gansevoort over Xmas 2011. Great location and ideal fo rmany sights to visit including the Hi Line.
2573	January 14, 2012	We stayed at the Gansevoort over the Christmas period . The hotel staff are friendly and efficient. The hotel is situated in a good area for restaurants and bars. It's a lovely hotel in a great area.
2574	January 14, 2012	Stayed 2 nights the last week of December. We live in NyC but arrayed as a mini break away from the kids. Upon arrival the front desk was warm and friendly. We had the room right below a suite and it was very lux. Window seat and big marble table overlooking the standard hotel and meatpacking. We at brunch at Pastis 2 days in a row and taxis and subway both extremely convenient. We went to the rooftop bar and on a Wed night it was packed. If we were younger we would have stayed. A very lively young scene I that's what you're looking for. I remembered calling to find out where the ice machine was and them telling me not to worry and in 3 minutes- ice at my door. Turn down service at night was great and maid service in the morning was quick and efficient.
2580	January 11, 2012	Loved the meat packing district like a village fabulous market great shopping even a german beer Keller great for a girls trip shopping food club whats not to like?
2581	January 11, 2012	I had high expectations for the "G" given the prestigious name and hip locale in the meatpacking district. Blah was more like it. It started great with an extremely friendly and helpful women at the front desk at check-in. We arrived early and our room was ready. That's the end of the positive. She asked if I'd like a newspaper to which I replied yes. Of course, no paper. The room was blazing hot (77 degrees! - an abnormally warm January day in NYC) and despite calls to maintenance we could not cool the room down. In fact, I don't know if they ever showed up and the man who answered my call at the front desk seemed indifferent to my request, if not a little rude. The only thing that cooled the room off was to open the window (which only opens a few inches) which of course is not advisable if you want to get any sleep. The room itself is rather uninspired. Nothing NYC about it. No character. Weak shower. The only shower head is a hand held apparatus. No free standing tub. You will definitely smash the bathroom door into the closet door at least three times. Needless to say, it's a moronic layout. Oh and bring night vision otherwise you won't be able to see jack in the hallways. I should give this hotel less than 3 stars but since the rate was only $250, it's a decent value and for my needs (2 blocks from my brother's apt.) it works.
2582	January 10, 2012	Being located in the heart of the meatpacking district and offering terrific views across the Hudson from the upper floor rooms may justify the room rates and a choice to stay here. On the other hand, is it really appropriate for sheets in a higher end hotel to have holes in them and for room furniture to look like it's been salvaged from a dumpster? The lobby bar/restaurant is similarly depressing in its decor and atmosphere and the rooftop bar/club is unappealing in the winter months.
2583	January 5, 2012	Great location and facilities not too bad but staff were incredibly unhelpful especially the concierge when asking simple things like can u recommend a nice Italian restaurant etc! Just got a blank, snobby expression and in the end we just decided to do our own research without the hotels help.\n\nAlso being unable to get a drink anywhere in the hotel on NYE was shocking. We were advised this was 'normal' because we didn't have a ticket to get into our own hotel and by this time they had sold out! You pay a higher rate on NYE and the hotel prides themselves on their excellent facilities but what's the point when you are told you can't use them!!\n\nHaving stayed at Soho House just opposite this hotel on every other occasion in the city this hotel just doesn't compare.
2584	January 1, 2012	A very cool hotel in a great location. The meatpacking district is always lively, night and day and this hotel is right in the heart of it. The rooftop bar is always busy with a changing crowd from casual sunset cocktail drinkers to hard core party goers dancing the night away. Beds were extremely comfortable and the rooms are kitted with a few nice extras (their own chill out CDs for you to listen to for example) but they are small, as can be expected in NYC. Would definitely stay here again.
2590	January 1, 2012	1. The hotel is located in the hub of NYC's best places to go at night and coolest fashion boutiques.\n2. The rooftop bar/club is a definite hot-spot; playing a great mix of music with a really quirky crowd.\n3. The service is second to none; The general managers were amazing. They were immediately responsive to every request and were on the whole a pleasure to deal with.\n4. The concierge service was extremely helpful with sorting out the best New Years Eve ever and with providing us with interesting things to do whilst in NYC.\n5. The bouncers, security and reception staff were really kind and friendly.\n\nWe thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and can't wait to return! We really recommend it for a hassle-free, edgy and enjoyable NYC break.
